For me, it was watching the SEC taking every digital message I gave them and apply whatever context it wanted to apply.  No matter what the truth was. Then I saw the success of Snapchat and realized that I wasn't the only one who had a need to reduce my digital footprint. Cyber Dust isn't designed to fight off the NSA or some nefarious intruder.  Cyber Dust is designed to replace texting for anyone who realizes that you lose control of every text you send.  [It’s also realizing] That the phone companies and your text recipients own your texts and even the most innocent text can take on a whole new context. I wanted to have a means of communication that is analogous to face to face - where you can speak openly and honestly. That is why we created Cyber Dust.”
I’ve realized how much people fear that their digital footprint is creating a digital profile of all us.  Your Facebook page.  Your tweets. Your Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram pages.  Your Spotify and Pandora playlists… All of these are being aggregated and evaluated to tell marketers what you like, don't like, buy, won't buy, your political affiliations.  Five plus years of all this data tells the world who you are - whether you wanted to or not.
NO, NOT FROM ALL OF MY BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE TRADITIONALLY A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES, A LOT OF MY SHARK TANK INVESTMENTS. WE FEEL GROWTH. I MEAN, WHETHER IT IS AT THE MAVS IN SELLING TICKETS, WATCHING THE NBA TICKET SALES, ALL OF THE LITTLE COMPANIES. IT FEELS LIKE IT'S GROWING. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE HAVING SEEN THE GDP REPORTS BEFORE AND THE .2 AND HAVING EVERYBODY FEEL LIKE THINGS WERE REALLY GOING BACKWARDS, I DIDN'T SEE IT. AND SO IT WAS GREAT TO SEE WHEN STEVE DID HIS WORK THAT WHAT WE WERE SEEING MATCHED WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBER SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
WELL, WHEN IT'S NOT SO GREAT, YOU LOOK AT YOUR OWN NUMBERS AND COMPARE THEM TO WHAT THE MACRO NUMBERS ARE. SO, YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT GDP IS MACRO, AND WHATEVER IS HAPPENING THERE, HOPEFULLY WE CAN COUNTER BALANCE IT WITH EFFORT ON OUR SIDE. BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE NUMBER, IT KIND OF SETS EXPECTATIONS. SO WHEN WE SAW THE .02, IT WAS LIKE, WELL WAIT. ARE THINGS SLOWING DOWN? DOES THAT IMPACT OTHER INVESTMENTS? SO, MY SHARK TANK COMPANIES, I JUST WANT THEM TO SELL MORE. THE MAVS, I JUST WANT THEM TO SELL MORE. BUT KNOWING NOW THAT THE NUMBER REFLECTS WHAT IT FELT LIKE, I THINK IT DOESN'T SO MUCH CHANGE WHAT THE COMPANIES DO, BUT IT CHANGES SOME INVESTMENT THESES – PERSPECTIVES THAT I HAVE.
YOU KNOW, .25%, 1%, THE MARGINAL COST TO ANY OF MY COMPANIES, THE MARGINAL COSTS OF THE COMPANIES I'M INVESTED IN, THE STOCKS – IRRELEVANT.
WELL, UP UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO, IT WAS THE BIBLE. NOW, IT IS BACK TO BEING A SUGGESTION BECAUSE LOOK, THE GREATER MESSAGE IS QUESTION AUTHORITY. RIGHT? I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING WE TOOK FOR GRANTED AS BEING A BIBLICAL NUMBER AND NOW CREDIT GOES TO STEVE WHERE HE CHALLENGED THE AUTHORITY AND WE REALIZE THAT NOT ONLY COULD THE GDP NUMBER BE WRONG ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BUT WHAT OTHER NUMBERS DO WE NEED TO QUESTION? SO I THINK IT REALLY CHANGES THE PERSPECTIVE FOR AN INVESTOR. I THINK, LOOK, HOW PEOPLE INVESTED TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS UP UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO JUST CHANGED.
DALLAS AND STATE OF TEXAS HAS TRADITIONALLY OUTPERFORMED THE COUNTRY, BUT I'M INVESTED IN PITTSBURGH, I'M INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA. I'M ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THAT MATTER. SO I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE MACRO ECONOMICS AND AS IT APPLIES TO THE U.S., IT WAS SHOCKING THAT YOU COULD BE SO FAR OFF. I MEAN, THAT'S NOT LIKE – AN ADJUSTMENT OF .1, RIGHT? THAT IS ENORMOUS.
LOOK, IT IS ALWAYS THE COVER UP THAT GETS YOU IN TROUBLE. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN FINED A LOT, I CAN TELL YOU THE PUNISHMENT – ROGER GOODELL, ANY COMMISSIONER OF ANY PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUE REPRESENTS HIS OWNERS. AND HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IN A VACUUM. AND SO MY GUESS IS WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING, THERE 25 PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL OWNERS WHO CALLED UP THE COMMISSIONER GOODELL AND SAID YOU HAVE TO THROW THE BOOK AT HIM BECAUSE HE TRIED TO COVER HIM UP. AND THOSE SAME 25 OWNERS CALLED UP ROBERT KRAFT AND SAID IT'S HORRIBLE WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO YOU. BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY UNDERPINS IT, I KNOW MY GUYS HAVE DONE THE SAME THING TO ME. IN THAT THEY WILL SAY I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. AND YOU WANT TO TRUST THEM. AND SO APPARENTLY THERE IS SOMETHING THERE IF HE PULLED HIS APPEAL. AND WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND WHAT INFORMATION TOM BRADY IS WILLING TO DISCLOSE. BUT, DOES IT FIT THE CRIME? HONESTLY, I'M JUST A FAN. I DON'T CARE.
NO, NOT REALLY. I JUST THINK THE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT. WHEN YOU HAVE 53 PLAYERS ON EACH TEAM THAT ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE WARRIORS AND BEAT THE HECK OUT OF EACH OTHER ON THE FIELD AND THEN BECOME PERFECT CITIZENS OFF THE FIELD, YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT A NORMAL POPULATION OF 20 TO 30-YEAR-OLD MEN AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. AND SO I DON'T THINK THEY ARE A DYSFUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION, BUT I THINK ANY ORGANIZATION THAT IS AT THE TOP OF THEIR FIELD, THAT IS JUST DOMINATING LIKE THE NFL IS, HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF CHALLENGES IN MAINTAINING THE LEAD AND STAYING AT THE TOP. AND THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT – I DON'T KNOW IF THE NFL IS DEALING WITH CORRECTLY.
YEAH, LOOK, THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE GAME. IF THERE WAS A TEMPLATE TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP, I'D BE USING IT EVERY YEAR. IT'S NOT EASY TO WIN. THOSE GUYS GET A LOT OF CREDIT, THEY'VE GOT SOME AMAZING PLAYERS. THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER AMAZING TEAMS. BUT FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, THE LEAGUE HAS NEVER BEEN ANY BETTER. I THINK THE CONFLUENCE OF THE MARKETING WE HAVE DONE, THE FACT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS REALLY PUSHED OUR PLAYERS TO DEFINE THEMSELVES AS BRANDS, THE FACT THAT BEING ON A BASKETBALL COURT YOU ARE MUCH MORE VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE THAN ANY OTHER SPORT HAS REALLY PLAYED TO OUR BENEFIT.
AND NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE OUR COMMISSIONER, ADAM SILVER'S POSITION ON GAMBLING. AND SO I HAVE BEEN VOCAL INTERNALLY ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD WORK TO LEGALIZE ALL FORMS OF SPORTS BETTING. NOT JUST IN LAS VEGAS AND SOME OTHER STATES. AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US AND PUSH US EVEN FURTHER.
NO. THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL MEDIA. AND TWITTER, THE SIGNAL TO NOISE ON TWITTER IS JUST WAY OUT OF WHACK. WE LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE TWEET AND WE TAKE IT AS REALLY BEING GOSPEL. I TRY TO TELL MY GUYS IT'S MORE BAR TALK, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS A LOT OF HATE. THE SIGNAL NOISE IS JUST OUT OF WHACK AND SO I WOULDN'T HAVE FIRED HIM BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK AT TWITTER AS BEING A NEWS SOURCE. I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS SOMETHING THAT REALLY REFLECTS THE ORGANIZATION. PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. THAT IS THE NATURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. AND THEN INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, VINE, WHATEVER IT MAY BE, HAS THEIR OWN BRAND OR IMAGE AS WELL. SO YEAH, I WOULD NOT HAVE FIRED HIM. BUT WHEN WE MAKE A MISTAKE, YOU OWN UP TO IT AND YOU SAY LOOK, IT WAS A MISTAKE. YOU DELETE IT AND YOU MOVE ON. AND LOOK, I HAVE A COMPANY, GET EXPIRED.COM, THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GO IN AND SEARCH FOR AND DELETE OLD TWEETS. BECAUSE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE TO LEAVING TWEETS OUT THERE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. AND SO YOU CAN EXPECT THAT WHATEVER YOU SAY TODAY ON TWITTER IS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT IN A MONTH, A YEAR, TWO YEARS.
I would also like to point out one other important element of consumer choice that an AT&T and Time Warner merger would improve.

Each of the largest content companies I have mentioned so far, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple present much if not all of their content algorithmically. As a Facebook user I don’t get to pick what content I get to see in my newsfeed. I can try to influence it, but Facebook algorithms control what I see.

In the future, it won’t be algorithms that choose what we see, our choices will be driven by some form of Artificial Intelligence learning from trillions of disparate inputs.

Meanwhile, for those of us who still enjoy our TV the old-fashioned way, on our couch, cold beverage in one hand and remote in the other, there is a lot to be said for having a company that can afford to continue to offer us that choice. As much of a geek as I am, I like having the choice of searching through a programming guide to see what’s on rather than an algorithm telling me what I should watch. I think a lot of consumers would like to see that choice continue as well.”
That's a good question. I think as an encryption technology, it's great. I think as a transport mechanism that it's unique and has a great opportunity in the future. I think it's got no shot as a long-term digital currency.
 I'd look at it, but more as fun. It's almost like buying and selling baseball cards. It's just about supply and demand, almost like buying stocks, too. But there's definitely risk involved if you're looking at it to be a long-term currency.

I analogize it very much to gold. You've got to physically hold gold. You have to physically hold your private key, which is the same thing as holding gold. It's more of a religion right now than it is anything else. There's … industrial applications for gold, but that doesn't drive the value. It's more perceived value.

And it's the same thing with Bitcoin. The perceived value of where it is going to go is what drives the day-to-day valuations and valuation swings.

The other telling tale in terms of currency, besides the fact that no central bank is going to ever let (go of) control of how they deal with their own economy, is no one that I've seen so far that's in traditional sales that is taking Bitcoin keeps it as Bitcoin. They all translate it to dollars. And if you translate it into dollars, it's not a currency.
It won't replace texting, but I want it to be a good complement to texting. We all have risks. When we text something, you lose control of it. It's not so much what we do, but it's the people who are on the receiving side. You don't know what they're going to do. In business, you could be talking about an employee, and someone keeps that text, and then they go to another company, and then all of a sudden, 'Look what he said.'

Over time, the things that we say digitally, including our texts, lose context. It may be something that made perfect sense that I texted it to you today, but if you keep that text or forward that text, three years from now if it surfaces (or becomes) discoverable in a lawsuit, then it loses all that context, and people can say it means anything. I think you really have to gain control of your digital footprint.

Kids are understanding that now. That's why Snapchat's been so popular. They don't want to have that footprint out there. They recognize that who you follow on Twitter, where you reply on Twitter, what you say on Pinterest, who you follow on Pinterest, who you follow on Tumblr, what you put on Tumblr, what you put on Facebook, who you follow on Facebook, that all defines who you are. That's all mine-able data to create a profile of you. Kids are recognizing that. And I think adults need to start recognizing that.
 It's consumer, too. My kids are angels, but there's going to be a time when my daughter sends a text to somebody that says, 'Oh, you're my favorite' or 'Thanks for last night, it was my best date ever.' And that scumbag boy keeps it and when they break up, sends it to his friends. The real goal is to understand that once you send a text and it's not in an application like Cyber Dust, then you lose control of it. And even in the most innocent of circumstances, whether it's business or personal, it can be misused."
Learn to sell. In business you’re always selling – to your prospects, investors and employees. To be the best salesperson put yourself in the shoes of the person to whom you’re selling. Don’t sell your product. Solve their problems.
Great companies start without investors. He cites Apple, Dell and Microsoft as a few examples. Given that he’s a venture capitalist, and he’s recommending not to take venture money, it’s certainly worth trying to avoid. That’s probably not possible in some cases – but it makes sense if you can pull it off.


That being said, don’t get caught up in how many hours you work. Judge success based on having goals and measuring your results. Hard work, and lots of it, is certainly needed, but focus on what you get done. What do you need to do to deliver for your client? To land the next customer? To expand within your customers? . . .
It was just a challenge. It was something I didn’t know how to do, it was live, and it was athletic. And on top of that, I had just got my hip replaced. So I could either go through rehab or go dancing with my wife Kim
You don’t think it was pragmatic to take that deal? Our last quarter was $23M+ per quarter. More than $100M per year. More than YouTube. We got 23 M shares of Yahoo as part of the deal. It was like we got 200 M dollars in real Yahoo stock. People don’t understand that back then we were screaming with over 100 M uniques per day. We had advertising – not only prerolls but inserted advertising. We had a test with a Texas AM football game where we inserted an audio ad. We bought a company called Simple Net that was all about user generated content. We started on the corporate side because the consumer side didn’t have broadband yet. So we sat down with people like Michael Dell and recorded videos for the net. So if I seem like I’m a cynic with web video, it’s because this stuff is all 10 years old. We’re just going through all of it again after the bust
I did, and I “retired” when I was 30. My goal was to drink with as many people in as many countries as possible. I sold a company and all I wanted was a lifetime pass for American Airlines. They had them for $125,000 for two people. I used to go into bars and ask women if they wanted to go on trips. But then, one of my buddies at Goldman said we should start a hedge fund and three years later we sold if for a lot of money. I was still drinking and traveling when I was asked to try streaming Indiana basketball games over the internet. I was reluctant because I already had my FU money but I took a look and put up some of my money. My first business card had Vice President on it because I didnt want to work. Before you could do live streaming, we figured it out and did it from there.
I’m a competitive person. Business is a much more competitive sport than any real sport. It’s 24x7x365. I’m a business adrenaline junky. Once I didn’t have to pay the bills, the best challenges were to come up with stuff that people said couldn’t be done. So when I started HDNet, people thought that it was stupid – HD TVs would never go mainstream. People said that consumers couldn’t tell the difference between HD and regular TVs anyway. So I put my money where my mouth was. And then I took a look at the movie business. I’m not creative but it looked fun and could provide content for HDNet. Plus I thought there was a better way to sell movies. So we decided to make a film for $750,000. I like to look at industries I just know are messed up. Everyone’s looking in one direction and I look in the other. We started Magnolia Pictures for distribution with the idea that we could provide movies where and when people want them. All our DVDs are not copy protected. If you want to copy them, please go out and do that.
Landmark, HDNet, and Magnolia are all making money. 2929 Entertainment is not making money yet but will in about a year. In aggregate, making money. I think we’re going to save the independent film business. Right now there are 600+ independent films per year, about 100 get theatrical distribution, about 10 make money. The whole process is broken so why don’t we tweak it even more? We created Ultra VOD that takes buzz around movies and puts it out to cable video on demand before they hit theaters. Why would we do that? There are so many pay-per-view commercials because they work. VOD sales make money and promote a movie. We sell it at a premium and because the cable companies get half, they promote the hell out of them. If we do $0.5M even before it hits theaters, we’re doing well. We recover lots of our costs. All of this is just built for more. On the flip side, the only national theater chain that will play those movies is Landmark. The others refuse because of the prerelease.
8 years. I let Dirk Nowitsky do what he wanted to do. It got voted worse franchise in business right before a bought it. It was worth $285M when bought, but now it’s about twice that much. You can beat yourself against the wall and they’re like stop stop stop but now we know I’m right. I’m quieter now because people listen. Before no one would listen. We try to be reasonable with seat prices when we’re both good and bad, because who knows when you’ll suck and fans will revolt.

If there was a template for success in sports, everyone would follow it. You do the best you can and trust the people you trust. I’ve learned the number one job of a pro manager is not to win championships but to keep their job.
In hindsight it was the right move but it was sad. We’ve all had situations where we worked with someone and developed emotional relationships, and Steve Nash and I had fun. But thats the way it works, you move on. I was terrified when he left.
In the past people used to tell me to shut up a bit. But what I believe is to put out your opinion and let everyone else react. If I’m wrong I’m wrong. People are afraid to put our their opinions and get push back.
 I just trust the person. I dont make as many as I did now with the Cubs thing and HDnet. But id say 80 percent of the deals I’ve done I’ve never met the people. Whatever you can say in a meeting you can put in an email. If I have questions, Ill tell you via email. With RedSwoosh, we met once in Las Vegas and never again. Blake Rose from IceRocket, I wouldnt know him if I walked down the street, but I might have emails with him 5-10 emails a day.
I guess Bill Gates. Larry Ellison I respect. You know, old school entrepreneurs, it was just diffferent. There was a different crede. I used to want to be profitable every month, before going IPO. But then later I accepted running at a loss. From the Netscape moving on, that’s what has happened since — the whole idea now is to get pageviews and then figure out a revenue model. I think entrepreneurs these days have been cheated because for them, its not about understanding how to make money. But when the money goes dry, you’re shit out of luck. When the bubble burst, 9 out of 10 businesses went away. With weblogs, our mantra was sales cures all. We used to talk about bottom line, not top line. It always came down to what you’re putting into your pocket. I want a cash-in-pocket strategy not an exit strategy.When you walk down these halls, you dont have people making money yet.
 I dont think the country’s in bad shape because theres all this entrepreneurial spirit here and elsewhere. That’ll never stop. People talk about taxes but thats not relevant to the success and creation of businesses in general. But boy, everyone in Washington – old and proposed – is doing everything they can to screw things up. No one can turn around Yahoo yet alone the country. I’ll probably vote for the person that’ll do the least, stay out of the way.
Ill tell you what I learned from Bobby Knight: everybody’s got the will to win but when it comes time to doing something, it’s always about someone else. Not many people have the will to prepare. You got to be willing to know your product and environment better than anybody. No matter what you do there is someone out there trying to kick your ass. You got to be the smartest guy in the room about your product. Then you need to have a revenue source. You need a company with a revenue to make money. Concept, competition, and where the money is — plus something you love doing. I’ve never had a day of work. When I die I want to come back as me.
Send me an email and in three paragraphs or less, tell me about your business. Dont say you need an NDA or want a call. Just tell me how youre going to make money and how I’m going to add value. Give me a URL if you have a website, I’ll figure it out. 5% of the people will hear back from me.
Winning, absorbing the journey and the destination. When all of it comes together, whether it’s something you started or took over, you get to look at yourself and everyone around you. Sports bonds families; different generations can talk together about sports. It’s the same within a business.
I’ve always been a driver from a tech perspective so it’s been easy to find people who complement me. Finding someone who you trust and who complements you is important. It’s easier to find people you trust who are cheap and can be trained. Believing in the business is important too. The worst place to hire is the Silicon valley because everyone’s a hero in their own mind. There are great people everywhere you can find. The poeple I dont like to work with are people like me. I need people who can compliment my skill set, people who can do the nitty gritty with me. People who will be good verse look good.
Realizing I was a terrible employee. Getting fired for selling on commission rather than cleaning floors. Also, before you have kids and get a mortgage, thats the time to go after it. I cant tell you how many girlriends I’ve had that said “me or the business”, and I said “whats your name?”
