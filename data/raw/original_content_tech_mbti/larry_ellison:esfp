 GOOD MORNING CLASS OF 2016. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE. I AM HONORED TO BE WITH YOU FOR YOUR GRADUATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS MORNING I WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT HOW A FEW EXPERIENCES AND COUPLE OF IDEAS TAUGHT ME SOME IMPORTANT LESSONS AND HELPED ME DISCOVER MY DREAMS. WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, LIVING IN GOING TO SCHOOL IN CHICAGO BACK IN THE 1960'S, I USED TO DREAM ABOUT THIS PLACE. THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BACK THEN, MY DREAM WAS TO GO TO THE USC MEDICAL SCHOOL, GET MARRIED, RAISING A FAMILY, AND PRACTICE MEDICINE IN LOS ANGELES. GROWING UP IN A LOWER MIDDLE-CLASS COMMUNITY ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF CHICAGO, MEDICINE WAS CONSIDERED THE PINNACLE OF PROFESSIONS. NOBLE AND HUMANE. VIRTUALLY EVERYONE IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE, MY FAMILY, MY TEACHERS, MY GIRLFRIEND, WANTED ME TO BE A DOCTOR. OVER TIME, THEIR DREAMS BECAME MY DREAMS. THEY CONVINCED ME. I SHOULD BE A DOCTOR. AS HARD AS I TRIED, I COULD NOT DO IT. AFTER A FEW DIFFICULT AND UNHAPPY YEARS, IT BECAME PAINFULLY CLEAR TO ME THAT I DID NOT LIKE THE COURSES I WAS TAKING. I THOUGHT MY COMPARATIVE ANATOMY CLASS WAS A PERVERSELY PUT IN THIS FORM OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE. ESPECIALLY THE DISSECTION LABS. I COULD NOT MAKE MYSELF STUDY SOMETHING THAT DID NOT INTEREST ME. AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT I LACKED DISCIPLINE. AND THAT I WAS SELFISH. MAYBE SO. WHATEVER THE UNDERLYING REASONS, I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE MYSELF INTO THE PERSON THAT I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE. SO I DECIDED TO STOP TRYING. I WAS 21 YEARS OLD WHEN I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE. I PACKED EVERYTHING I OWNED, JEANS, T-SHIRTS, JACKET, QATAR, INTO MY CAR, AND DROVE FROM CHICAGO TO BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA. I GUESS ONE SMALL PART OF THAT UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INJURING WAS MINE AFTER ALL. THE CALIFORNIA PART. BERKELEY IN THE 1960'S WAS AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING. THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT, THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT, THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IT WAS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR AN UNDISCIPLINED, SELFISH TWENTYSOMETHING TO BEGIN HIS SEARCH FOR HIMSELF, A RIGHTEOUS CAUSE, AND A JOB THAT HE LOVED. EVERYONE LIVING IN BERKELEY IN THE 1960'S OPPOSED THE VIETNAM WAR. I WAS NOT DIFFERENT. IT WAS THE AGE OF AQUARIUS, BUT I NEVER HAD LONG HAIR AND I NEVER WORE BEADS DID I LEARNED TO PLAY POPULAR SONGS ON MY GUITAR BUT I WAS NEVER A COMMITTED, SERIOUS ANTIWAR PROTESTER. I FOUND A CAUSE, HOWEVER. ONE I STILL FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT TODAY. A FEW HOURS EAST OF BERKELEY ARE THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THOSE MOUNTAINS AND THE INEFFABLE NATURAL BEAUTY OF YOSEMITE. I CARED ABOUT THE WILDERNESS AND I WANTED TO HELP PRESERVE IT AND I JOINED THE SIERRA CLUB, BECAME AN ENVIRONMENTALIST. DURING MY CALIFORNIA SPRINGS AND SUMMERS, I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS IN THE HIGH SIERRA'S AND YOSEMITE VALLEY, WORKING AS A RIVER GUIDE AND A ROCK CLIMBING INSTRUCTOR. I LOVED THOSE JOBS PER BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DID NOT PAY THAT WELL. SO I ALSO GOT A JOB WORKING A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK AS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER BACK IN BERKELEY. I HAD LEARNED TO PROGRAM IN COLLEGE. I DO NOT LOVE PROGRAMMING BUT IT WAS FUN AND I WAS GOOD AT IT. COMPUTER PROGRAMMING GAVE ME THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION FOR SOLVING MATH PROBLEMS AND LEAVING -- PLAYING CHESS -- BOTH THINGS I ENJOYED BEFORE ANYTHING IN A CONFUSED TEENAGER. AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING REAL PROGRESS ON MY JOURNEY OF SELF-DISCOVERY. I HAD FOUND A BECAUSE, AT A COUPLE OF JOBS, AND ONE THAT WAS FUN AND PAID THE BILLS. I WAS PRETTY HAPPY WITH MY LIFE. MY WIFE WAS NOT. WHAT SHE SAW WAS A COLLEGE DROPOUT WHO SPENT TOO MUCH TIME IN THE MOUNTAINS DOING FOOLISH THINGS P SHE WANTED ME TO WORK FULL-TIME AS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER OR GO BACK TO COLLEGE AND FINISH MY DEGREE. WE COMPROMISE. SORT OF. I STARTED TAKING CLASSES AT UC BERKELEY. I TOOK SEVERAL CLASSES BUT THE ONLY ONE I CAN REMEMBER WAS A SAILING CLASS TAUGHT AT THE MARINA ONCE AGAIN, I FELL IN LOVE AND BEGAN A LIFELONG AFFAIR WITH THE LIMITLESS OMNIPOTENT PACIFIC OCEAN. WHEN MY CLASS WAS OVER, I WANT TO BUY A SAILBOAT AND MY WIFE SAID, THIS WAS THE SINGLE STUPIDEST IDEA SHE HAD EVER HEARD IN HER ENTIRE LIFE. SHE ACCUSED ME OF BEING A RESPONSIBLE AND SHE TOLD ME I LACKED AMBITION. SHE KICKED ME OUT. AND THEN SHE DIVORCED ME. THIS WAS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN MY LIFE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] MY FAMILY WAS STILL MAD AT ME FOR NOT GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND NOW MY WIFE WAS DIVORCING ME BECAUSE I LACKED AMBITION. IT LOOKED LIKE A REOCCURRENCE OF THE SAME PROBLEM, ONCE AGAIN, I WAS UNABLE TO LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS. BUT THIS TIME, I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF. FOR FAILING TO BE THE PERSON THEY THOUGHT I SHOULD BE. THEIR TRAINS AND MY DREAMS WERE DASHED THEIR DREAMS IN MY DREAMS WERE DIFFERENT AND WOULD NEVER CONFUSE THE TWO OF THEM AGAIN. I DISCOVERED THINGS THAT I LOVED, THE SIERRA MOUNTAINS, YOSEMITE, THE PACIFIC OCEAN, THESE NATURAL WONDERS PROBABLY JOY AND HAPPINESS AND WOOD FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I HAD AN INTERESTING JOB PROGRAMMING COMPUTERS AND MORE MONEY THAN I NEEDED. FOR THE FIRST TIME, I WAS CERTAIN THAT I WAS GOING TO SURVIVE. A HUGE BURDEN OF FEAR HAD BEEN LIFTED. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT MOMENT. IT WAS A TIME FOR REJOICING. I BOUGHT THE SAILBOAT AND LIVED ON BOARD, JUST ME AND MY CATS IN BERKELEY. IN THE WORDS OF JAMES JOYCE, I WAS ALONE AND YOUNG AND WILLFUL AND UNHEEDED, BUT I WAS HAPPY, AND NEAR TO THE WILD HEART OF LIFE. THROUGHOUT MY 20'S, I CONTINUED EXPERIMENTING AND TRY DIFFERENT THINGS, RACING BIKES AND THOSE IN CONSTANTLY CHANGING JOBS. IT DID NOT TAKE ME LONG TO DISCOVER THAT THE MOST INTERESTING AND REWARDING PROGRAMMING JOBS WERE FOUND AT A CLUSTER OF COMPANIES LOCATED SOUTH OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND NORTH OF SAN JOSE. SILICON VALLEY WAS IN ITS INFANCY. I WAS STILL IN MY 20'S WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR MY FIRST SILICON VALLEY STARTUP. WE DEVELOPED THE WORLD'S FASTEST MAINFRAME COMPUTER, FASTER THAN ANYTHING IBM HAD. AT THE NEXT STOP, WE BUILT THE WORLD'S LARGEST DIGITAL DATA STORAGE SYSTEM. THEN ON TO PRECISION INSTRUMENTS WHERE WE BUILT AN EVEN LARGER STORAGE SYSTEM, THIS TIME USING LASERS. I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS ALL VERY CUTTING EDGE AND CHALLENGING AND COOL. I LIKED MY WORK MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DID NOT LOVE IT. I SEARCHED AND I SEARCHED BUT I JUST COULD NOT FIND A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOB THAT I LOVED AS MUCH AS I LOVED SAILING. SO I TRIED TO CREATE ONE. I PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO START MY OWN COMPANY. THAT WAY, I COULD COMPLETELY CONTROL MY WORK ENVIRONMENT. I WOULD HIRE THE MOST TALENTED PROGRAMMERS I KNEW AND WE WOULD ALL WORK TOGETHER. ON THE MOST INTERESTING AND CHALLENGING SOFTWARE PROJECTS. MY GOAL WAS TO CREATE THE PERFECT JOB FOR ME, A JOB I TRULY LOVED. I NEVER EXPECTED THE COMPANY TO GROW BEYOND 50 PEOPLE. MAYBE I REALLY DID LACK AMBITION OR VISION. I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO AND I WAS VERY YOUNG. ANYWAY, TODAY ORACLE EMPLOYEES WHO WANTED TO 50,000 PEOPLE. WHEN I STARTED, IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO BUILD A BIG COMPANY. WHAT HAPPENED? WE HIRED THE MOST TALENTED SOFTWARE ENGINEERS IN SILICON VALLEY. WE ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF GIFTED PROGRAMMERS WHO WERE AMONG THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT WHAT THEY DID. THAT TEAM PLUS ONE CRAZY IDEA GAVE BIRTH TO A GIANT COMPANY. I CALLED IT A CRAZY IDEA BECAUSE AT THE TIME, EVERYONE TOLD ME IT WAS A CRAZY IDEA. THE IDEA WAS TO BUILD THE WORLD'S FIRST RELATIONAL DATABASE. SEVERAL THEORETICAL PAPERS ABOUT IT AT ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED AND IBM WAS BUILDING A PROTOTYPE RAID BACK THEN, THE COLLECTIVE WISDOM OF COMPUTER EXPERTS WAS THAT WHILE THEY COULD BE BUILT, THEY WOULD NEVER BE FASTENER TO BE USEFUL. I THOUGHT ALL OF THOSE SO-CALLED COMPUTER EXPERTS WERE WRONG. AND WHEN YOU START TELLING PEOPLE THAT ALL THE EXPERTS ARE WRONG, AT FIRST THEY CALL YOU ARROGANT, AND THEN THEY SAY YOU ARE CRAZY. SO REMEMBER THIS, GRADUATES. WHEN PEOPLE START TELLING YOU THAT YOU ARE CRAZY, YOU JUST MIGHT BE ONTO THE MOST IMPORTANT INNOVATION IN YOUR LIFE. [APPLAUSE] THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS YOU ARE CRAZY. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN THE EXPERTS WERE WRONG. ARROGANCE AND INSANITY TURNED OUT TO BE INNOVATION IN DISGUISE. THE ORACLE DATABASE PROVED TO BE A DEFINING TECHNOLOGY AT THE DON OF THE INFORMATION AGE. THE ORACLE DATABASE TOTALLY UPENDED MY PLAN TO BUILD A SMALL, COMFORTABLE COMPANY, A PERFECT PLACE FOR ME AND A FEW OF MY FRIENDS. AS THE INFORMATION AGE MOVED TO THE LIGHT OF DAY, TECHNOLOGY HORIZONS WERE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING, REVEALING A BRAVE AND EXCITING WORLD OF NEW POSSIBILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES. ORACLE DOUBLED IN SIZE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR, FOR 10 YEARS. I SET OUT TO CREATE THE PURPOSE -- PERFECT PROGRAMMING JOB FROM A PAIRED INSTEAD, I CREATED A JOB WHERE I HAD TO STOP PROGRAMMING ALTOGETHER. I ATTEMPTED TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT I COULD COMPLETELY JOB. INSTEAD, I WAS RUNNING A COMPANY WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WAS GROWING SO FAST THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO CONTROL. IT WAS LIKE SAILING IN A HURRICANE. THEN WE WENT PUBLIC. OH, MY GOD. MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DOCTOR. I WAS CONSTANTLY LEARNING, EVERY DAY I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW AND INTERESTING, SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT KNOW THE DAY BEFORE. MY NEW JOBLESS CHALLENGING, CAPTIVATING, CONSUMING. I WORKED ALL THE TIME BUT THINKING BACK, I AM PRETTY SURE I DID NOT LOVE IT OR MAYBE I WAS JUST TOO TIRED TO EVEN KNOW HOW I FELT. I HAD FOUND A PLACE IN THE WORLD. MY FAMILY FINALLY FORGIVE ME FOR NOT GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. NOBODY EVER ACCUSED ME OF LACKING AMBITION AGAIN. I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ONE LAST STORY ABOUT MY BEST FRIEND, A GUY WHO HAD LOTS OF CRAZY IDEAS AND TELL ME AN IMPORTANT LESSON. MY FRIENDSHIP WITH STEVE JOBS WAS MADE UP OF A THOUSAND WALKS IT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, WE WOULD GO FOR A WALK. WE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF WINDY HILL, HIKED THROUGH THE SINS -- SANS S -- ONE PARTICULAR WALK STOOD UP YOUR WE HAD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SO WE JUMPED IN THE CAR, BUT THE TOP DOWN ANDA HEADED OUT TO CASTLE ROCK STATE PARKNDS. IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS. IT WAS OVER 20 YEARS AGO. BACK IN MAY 1995. STEVE WAS FINISHING TOY STORY AND FIX OUR -- PIXAR. APPLE WAS IN SEVERE DISTRESS. IT HAD GONE STEADILY DOWNHILL DURING THE 10 YEARS OF HIS ABSENCE. THE PROBLEMS WERE NOW SO SERIOUS PEOPLE WERE WONDERING IF APPLE WOULD SURVIVE. IT WAS ALL TOO PAINFUL TO WATCH AND DO NOTHING. SO THE PURPOSE OF THAT PARTICULAR HIKE THROUGH THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY WAS TO DISCUSS TAKING OVER APPLE COMPUTER. MY IDEA WAS SIMPLE. PURCHASE APPLE. AND IMMEDIATELY MAKE STEVE CEO. IT WAS NOT WORTH MUCH BACK THEN, ABOUT $5 BILLION. WE BOTH HAD REALLY GOOD CREDIT. I HAD ALREADY ARRANGED TO BORROW ALL OF THE MONEY. ALL STEVE HAD TO DO WAS SAY YES. STEVE PROPOSED A SOMEWHAT MORE CIRCUITOUS APPROACH. FIRST, PERSUADE APPLE TO BUY NEXT COMPUTER. THEN STEVE WOULD JOIN THE APPLE BOARD IN OVERTIME THE BOARD WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT STEVE WAS THE RIGHT GUY TO LEAD THE COMPANY. I SAID, OK. THAT MIGHT WORK. BUT STEVE, IF WE DO NOT BUY APPLE, HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE ANY MONEY? SUDDENLY STEVE TOP -- STOPPED WALKING AND TURNED TOWARD ME. HE PUT HIS LEFT HAND ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER AND HIS RIGHT HAND ON MY LEFT SHOULDER. STARING UNBLINKINGLY INTO MY EYES, STEVE SAID, VERY, THIS IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT I AM YOUR FRIEND. YOU DO NOT NEED ANY MORE MONEY. I SAID, I KNOW, I KNOW. THEN I SAID, BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP IT, WE CAN GIVE IT ALL AWAY. I WAS WHINING. STEVE JUST SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID, I AM NOT DOING THIS FOR THE MONEY. I DON'T WANT TO GET PAID. IF I DO THIS, I NEED TO DO THIS STANDING ON THE MORAL HIGH GROUND. THE MORAL HIGH GROUND, I SAID? THAT JUST MIGHT BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE REAL ESTATE OWNERS. -- REAL ESTATE ON EARTH -- BUT I KNEW I HAD LOST THE ARGUMENT STEVE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND AT CASTLE ROCK IN THE SUMMER OF 1995 TO SAVE APPLE HIS WAY. AT THE END, I SAID, STEVE, YOU CREATED APPLE, IT IS YOUR COMPANY, AND IT IS YOUR CALL. I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO. I WENT ONTO THE APPLE BOARD AND I WATCHED STEVE BUILD THE MOST VIABLE COMPANY ON EARTH. THE LESSON HERE IS VERY CLEAR TO ME. STEVE WAS RIGHT. AFTER A CERTAIN POINT, IT CANNOT BE ABOUT THE MONEY. AFTER A CERTAIN POINT, YOU CANNOT SPEND IT NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY. I KNOW, I HAVE TRIED HARD. BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE ONLY PRACTICAL OPTION IS TO GIVE NEARLY ALL OF IT AWAY. SO WHY DID STEVE CALLED BACK TO APPLE, WHY DID HE DEVOTE SO MUCH OF WHAT REMAINED OF HIS LIFE TO HIS JOB? WHY DO I? I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS THAT DEEP INSIDE OF ALL OF US, ALL OF US, THERE IS A PRIMAL DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING IMPORTANT WITH OUR LIVES. FREUD SAID THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS IMPORTANT IN LIFE. LOVE, AND WORK. HE DID NOT SAY LOVE AND WORK WERE THE SAME THING. I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY WORK. IT CONTINUES TO GIVE ME GREAT SATISFACTION AND A SENSE OF WHO I AM. PASSION AND LOVE ARE DIFFERENT. AT LEAST FROM AAR. I LOVE MY FAMILY. A FEW PRECIOUS FRIENDS, FOR CATS, TWO DOGS, CHERRY BLOSSOMS IN JAPAN, PACIFIC ISLAND BEACHES, AND THE MAJESTIC SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN FOR ME. MY FEELINGS ABOUT WORK ARE VERY INTENSE BUT QUITE DIFFERENT. THERE WAS A TELEVISION ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE NAVY THAT SAYS IT IS NOT JUST A JOB, IT IS AN ADVENTURE. THAT IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT MY YEARS IN SILICON VALLEY. AN INTERESTING, CHALLENGING, ALL-CONSUMING ADVENTURE. LIKE ANY ONGOING ADVENTURE, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT ENDS, BUT I KNOW IT WELL, FOR ME, AND A LONG, LONG TIME FROM NOW, FOR ALL OF YOU. BUT TODAY, GRADUATES, YOU ARE BEGINNING YOUR GREAT VENTURE. YOUR GENERATION WILL CHANGE THE WORLD'S AN FREE GENERATION WAS PRETTY WILL INVENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CREATE NEW TYPES OF ART. AND POSSIBILITIES WILL BE TRANSFORMED AND POSSIBILITIES. UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITIES WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES. YOU WILL CHANGE THE WORLD. AND THE WORLD WILL CHANGE YOU, AS YOU LEARN AND GROW AND DISCOVER MORE ABOUT YOURSELF. REMEMBER THIS. IN A CONSTANTLY CHANGING WORLD, WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS A MOVING TARGET. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO EXPERIMENT AND TRY LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. DO NOT LET THE EXPERTS DISCOURAGE YOU WHEN YOU CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO. LIKE MARK TWAIN SAYS, WHAT IS AN EXPERT, ANYWAY? JUST SOME GUY FROM OUT OF TOWN. EACH OF YOU HAS THE CHANCE TO DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE AND WHO YOU SHOULD BE, A CHANCE TO LIVE YOUR DREAMS, NOT THE DREAMS OF OTHERS. EACH OF YOU HAS AN OBLIGATION TO COMMIT TO A RIGHTEOUS CAUSE, ONE THAT ELEVATES YOU AND IMPROVES THE CONDITIONS OF HUMANITY AND THE PLANET. MANY OF YOU WILL BEGIN A NEW JOB. I HOPE IT INTERESTS YOU AND CHALLENGES YOU. AND REPORTS YOU WITH A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND SATISFACTION. BUT IF IT DOES NOT, KEEP SEARCHING. IT IS OUT THERE. IT MIGHT TAKE A A WHILE BUT KEEP SEARCHING, AND UNTIL YOU FIND A JOB THAT IT NIGHTS THEIR PASSIONS, LIKE I DID. EVEN BETTER, YOU JUST MIGHT FIND ONE THAT YOU LOVE. THANK YOU, AND CONGRATULATIONS.


I DO, I DO. ACTUALLY MY FAMILY AND I OWN THE MAJORITY OF THAT COMPANY. I STARTED THAT COMPANY WITH EVAN GOLDBERG BACK IN 1998—VERY PROUD OF THAT. AND THEN MARC BENIOFF STARTED SALESFORCE.COM IN 1999, AND KIND OF THE MODERN CLOUD BEGAN BACK IN THE LATE ‘90s. ORACLE WAS A WELL ESTABLISHED SOFTWARE COMPANY AT THE TIME, BUT GRADUALLY WE HAVE BEEN MOVING OUR APPLICATIONS—OR RE-WRITING OUR APPLICATIONS FOR THE CLOUD. AND WE COMPLETED A SEVEN YEAR RE-WRITE OF ALL OF OUR APPLICATIONS – HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, FINANCE, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT—WE COMPLETED THAT LAST YEAR AND ANNOUNCED FUSION APPLICATIONS FOR THE CLOUD. WE ALSO PROVIDE OUR DATABASE IN THE CLOUD, THE NUMBER ONE DATABASE IN THE WORLD IN THE CLOUD, THE MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD, JAVA, IS FROM ORACLE, THAT’S IN THE CLOUD. FUSION MIDDLEWARE, THE MOST POPULAR MIDDLEWARE IN THE WORLD, IS IN THE CLOUD. AND THEN WE ANNOUNCED A WHOLE BUNCH OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY HARDWARE DESIGNED FOR THE CLOUD CALLED OUR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS.

WELL IT MEANS THAT THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS KIND OF COMING OF AGE, ADOPTING UTILITY MODEL OF COMPUTING. ALL OTHER NETWORKS HAVE A UTILITY MODEL, ANOTHER WORDS ELECTRICITY POWERED GENERATION. THE COMPLEXITY OF GENERATING POWER AND DISTRIBUTING POWER IS HIDDEN FROM THE CONSUMER OF POWER. CONSUMERS JUST PLUG IN TO THE ELECTRIC NETWORK. THEY DON’T WORRY ABOUT WHETHER IT IS GENERATED BY COAL OR SOLAR OR WIND OR HOW THE ENERGY IS CREATED. THEY IGNORE THAT. THAT IS HANDLED BY THE ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDER. THEY DON’T HAVE TO MAKE HUGE INVESTMENTS IN CREATING MORE ELECTRICITY THAT’S ALL DONE AS A SERVICE. COMPUTING IS NOW BEING OFFERED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IF YOU WILL, OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS A SERVICE IN THE CLOUD. IT MEANS CONSUMERS DON’T HAVE TO GET BOGGED DOWN WITH COMPLEXITY OF COMPUTING AND THEY DON’T HAVE TO MAKE THAT HUGE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. THEY JUST PLUG IN, RUN THEIR APPLICATIONS.

WELL ACTUALLY, OUR BUSINESS IS FAIRLY GOOD. I KNOW IN REPORTED U.S. DOLLARS OUR REVENUE DROPPED SLIGHTLY—A COUPLE OF PERCENT—BUT THAT’S REALLY BECAUSE THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED, IT WAS AN EXCHANGE RATE CONVERSION. WE DO A LOT OF BUSINESS IN EUROPE AND WHEN WE CONVERTED THOSE EUROS INTO DOLLARS THIS YEAR WE GOT A LOT FEWER DOLLARS THAN WE DID THE PREVIOUS YEAR, I MEAN COMPARE THE TWO YEARS, WE ACTUALLY GREW OUR REVENUE BUT NOT IN TERMS OF DOLLARS. IN TERMS OF EUROS THEY WENT UP, ONCE WE CONVERTED THEM TO DOLLARS THEY WENT DOWN. SO OUR BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY GOOD. OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS IS GROWING AND THE PART OF OUR HARDWARE BUSINESS THAT WE CARE ABOUT MOST, OUR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, ARE GROWING AT OVER 100% RATE.
WE’RE NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR ACQUISITIONS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT OVER THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS WE REENGINEERED ALL OF OUR APPLICATIONS FOR THE CLOUD. WE THINK THAT’S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR ORGANIC GROWTH. WE’VE MADE A NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS AS YOU POINT OUT, INCLUDING SUN MICROSYSTEMS. SUN MICROSYSTEMS HAS ENABLED US TO TAKE THEIR HARDWARE ENGINEERING TEAM AND COMBINE IT WITH OUR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TEAM, AND DEVELOP THESE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS WHERE THE HARDWARE AND THE SOFTWARE IS ENGINEERED TOGETHER SO THESE SYSTEMS DEVELOPER MUCH GREATER SERVICE AT A MUCH LOWER COST THAN CONVENTIONAL COMPUTERS. SO WE THINK WE HAVE ALL THE ASSETS IN HOUSE TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY ON AN ORGANIC BASIS.
NETAPPS. AGAIN, THAT’D BE A VERY LARGE ACQUISITION. THEY ARE A GOOD COMPANY BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON ANY LARGE ACQUISITIONS. WE THINK THE ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR US IN THE CLOUD AND WITH ENGINEERED SYSTEMS ARE ENORMOUS AND THAT’S WHAT WE’RE FOCUSED ON.


WELL LET’S LOOK AT WHERE WE’VE DONE INNOVATION. ENGINEERED SYSTEMS, WE TOOK OUR DATABASE AND SUN HARDWARE AND WE MADE A BUNCH OF CHANGES TO BOTH. BOTH ON THE HARDWARE SIDE USING AN INVENTIVE…NETWORKING, USING A LOT OF FLASH MEMORY, WE REENGINEERED OUR DATABASE TO BE AN IN MEMORY SYSTEM AND WE JUST ANNOUNCED EXADATA, VERSION X3, WHICH RUNS ALL OF YOUR DATABASE IN MEMORY DELIVERING PERFORMANCE 10 SOMETIMES 1OO TIMES FASTER. THAT’S A COMBINATION OF ASSETS WE ACQUIRED AND ASSETS WE’VE HAD FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THE SUN HARDWARE AND THE ORACLE DATABASE SOFTWARE COMBINE AND A NEW GENERATION OF SYSTEMS THAT WE THINK REVOLUTIONIZE SERVER COMPUTING.
WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF NICHE COMPANIES, YOU KNOW SALESFORCE IS VERY GOOD AT APPLICATIONS IN THE CLOUD FOR SALES AUTOMATION. WE HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLETE SUITE OF APPLICATIONS IN THE CLOUD, WE DON’T JUST DO SALES AUTOMATION OR MARKETING AUTOMATION. WE ALSO DO ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL PLANNING AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND TALENT MANAGEMENT ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO WE HAVE A COMPLETE SUITE OF APPLICATIONS IN THE CLOUD. THAT’S SOMETHING A SMALL COMPANY CAN’T DO. THAT’S A LOT OF WORK. BUT UNDERLYING THAT COMPLETE SUITE OF CLOUD APPLICATIONS WE HAVE THE WORLDS NUMBER ONE PLATFORM. YOU KNOW, THE CLOUD IS DIVIDED UP INTO THREE PIECES, SAAS, THE APPLICATIONS, PAAS, THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS A SERVICE THE UNDERLYING HARDWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM. ORACLE PARTICIPATES IN ALL THREE LAYERS OF THE CLOUD AND THAT’S WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT. WHEN CUSTOMERS BUY A CLOUD THEY GET APPLICATIONS, THEY GET A PLATFORM, A DATABASE, MIDDLEWARE JAVA, AND THEY GET THE UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE, THE OPERATING SYSTEM VIRTUAL MACHINE AND THE HARDWARE. ORACLE IS THE ONLY COMPANY IN THE WORLD THAT INNOVATES AT ALL THREE LAYERS OR DEVELOPS, ENGINEERS, INVESTS AT ALL THREE LAYERS OF THE CLOUD. WE THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A NICHE PROVIDER TO COMPETE WITH US.
WELL WE HAVE TWO HARDWARE BUSINESSES WE HAVE A HARDWARE BUSINESS THAT CARE ABOUT THIS IS EXADATA EXALOGIC EXALYTICS KIND OF OUR NEW GENERATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERED TO WORK TOGETHER. SO THAT’S GROWING AT MORE THAN 100%. BUT THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER HARDWARE BUSINESS KIND OF THE OLD COMMODITY X86 BUSINESS WHICH IS SIMILAR IT IS BASICALLY TAKING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS ADDING MEMORY AND SELLING THESE COMMODITY BOXES AND THAT BUSINESS IS SHRINKING. SO WE’VE GOT TWO THINGS GOING ON WE’VE GOT THIS OLD SUN BUSINESS OF SELLING COMMODITY HARDWARE WHICH IS DISAPPEARING WHICH WE DON’T CARE ABOUT AT ALL AND OUR NEW BUSINESS OF SELLING ENGINEERED SYSTEMS WHICH IS MORE THAN DOUBLING. AND THE OLD BUSINESS IS SHRINKING SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE NEW BUSINESS IS GROWING. BUT THOSE TWO LINES WILL CROSS AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WE’LL GET VERY RAPID GROWTH BECAUSE THE BULK OF OUR BUSINESS WILL BE ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND THIS NEW VERY HOT UNIX BOX ARE SPARK T4 WHICH IS ALSO GROWING VERY, VERY RAPIDLY.
YOU CAN SEE THE DRAG. OUR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS DOUBLED, OUR T4 BUSINESS IS GROWING DOUBLE DIGITS SO OUR HOT BUSINESSES THEY ARE GROWING VERY RAPIDLY. YET THE OVERALL HARDWARE BUSINESS SHRANK IN THE LAST SEVERAL QUARTERS. SO EVENTUALLY THE LARGE COMMODITY BUSINESSES BECOME SMALL COMMODITY BUSINESSES AND THE SMALL FAST GROWING ENGINEER BUSINESSES BECOME LARGE BUSINESSES THAT’S WHEN THOSE TWO LINES CROSS AND THEY’LL CROSS THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND THE OVERALL HARDWARE BUSINESS WILL GROW. IT’S HAPPENING EXACTLY AS WE EXPECT AND AS WE PREDICT. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SHRINKING WE MAKE NO MONEY THOSE ARE THE COMMODITY BUSINESSES THE ENGINEER SYSTEMS BUSINESSES WHICH ARE DOUBLING WE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE ADD A LOT OF VALUE WE HAVE A LOT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE HAVE NO IP AN X86 BOX THE IP BELONGS TO MICROSOFT AND INTEL. WE ARE JUST A REDISTRIBUTOR OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY. WE DON’T CARE ABOUT THAT BUSINESS IT COULD SHRINK TO ZERO WE DON’T CARE.
WELL WE COULD DO A BIG DEAL AGAIN YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD. I AM JUST SAYING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SENIOR MANAGEMENT DOWN TO INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMERS AND SALES PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON ONE THING SELLING APPLICATIONS IN THE CLOUD, SELLING OUR PLATFORM IN THE CLOUD AND SELLING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CLOUD. SO WE ARE LASER LIGHT FOCUSED ON THAT KIND OF ORGANIC GROWTH AND THAT HUGE ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITY FOR US. COUPLE OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE COULD LOOK AT A BIG ACQUISITION AGAIN SO HAVING A LOT OF CASH IN THE BANK IS NOT A BAD THING. MY FRIEND STEVE JOBS KEPT LOTS OF CASH IN THE BANK.
YEAH IT WAS ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO WHEN HE PASSED AWAY. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND FOR 25 YEARS. AND HE’S JUST IRREPLACEABLE. IRREPLACEABLE IN OUR INDUSTRY. IRREPLACEABLE AS MY FRIEND.
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THAT COMPANY. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR TIM COOK BUT I’LL SAY IT AGAIN STEVE’S IRREPLACEABLE. WE’VE ALL LOST SOMETHING. HE WAS OUR EDISON. HE WAS OUR PICASSO. THERE’S NO ONE LIKE HIM. AGAIN APPLE WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE BUT NOT LIKE WHEN STEVE WAS AROUND.
RIGHT NOW THE PLAN IS FOR THE THREE OF US TO RUN THE COMPANY. ORACLE IS A COMPANY OF ALMOST 120,000 PEOPLE WE’VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I AM GOOD AT SOME THINGS. AND MARK IS GOOD AT SOME THINGS AND SAFRA IS GOOD AT SOME THINGS. SAFRA RUNS OPERATIONS, MARK RUNS THE FIELD ORGANIZATION AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THE ENGINEERING TEAM. I GET A LOT OF HELP IN ENGINEERING FROM THOMAS CURRY AND JOHN FOWLER THESE GUYS DO SPECTACULAR JOBS ON THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SIDE OF THINGS. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF TALENT. WE’VE GOT QUALITY AND QUANTITY AT ORACLE AND WE WORK PRETTY WELL TOGETHER AS A TEAM.
WELL I THINK THERE WERE TWO REASONS ONE MARK’S A FRIEND. BUT THE WAS LOOK WHAT MARK DID WHEN HE WAS AT H-P. PEOPLE FORGET HOW MUCH TROUBLE H-P WAS IN WHEN HE TOOK OVER. AND WHAT A SPECTACULAR JOB HE DID OVER THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD AT H-P. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE RESULTS. IT IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE LOOKING AT THE APPLE RESULTS. H-P WITHOUT MARK HURD, H-P WITH MARK HURD, H-P WITHOUT MARK HURD. SAME THING WITH APPLE – APPLE WITH STEVE JOBS, APPLE WITHOUT STEVE JOBS, APPLE WITH STEVE JOBS. SO IS LEADERSHIP IMPORTANT I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE BOARD MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A HUGE DISSERVICE TO H-P EMPLOYEES. I LOVE THAT COMPANY. THE COMPANY H-P, I LOVE. EVERYONE WHO IS RAISED IN SILICON VALLEY THINKS OF H-P AS AN ICON. THEY DESERVE THE BEST LEADERSHIP AND MARK WAS PROVIDING IT. THESE GUYS AREN’T EASY TO REPLACE.
WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF DEPTH. NOW WE’VE GOT MARK. YOU GUYS DON’T WANT MARK. WE’LL TAKE HIM. WE’VE GOT SAFRA. WE’VE GOT THOMAS AND JOHN AND LARRY TOO SO IT’S A GOOD TEAM.


WELL AGAIN, THAT IS A DECISION FOR THE ORACLE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. I CAN’T MAKE THAT ON MY OWN, BUT I BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS GRADUALLY INCREASE THE DIVIDEND AS OPPOSED TO DOUBLING IT OR TRIPLING IT ALL AT ONCE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I THINK YOU WILL SEE GRADUAL AND REGULAR INCREASES IN THE DIVIDEND, BUT NOTHING DRAMATIC.
WELL FOR EXAMPLE, I BOUGHT A HOME IN NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND WHICH I’M CONVERTING INTO A 19TH CENTURY EUROPEAN ART MUSEUM. SO I BOUGHT THE ASTOR MANSION ON CLIFF WALK IN NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND AND I GOT THIS IDEA. MY FAVORITE MUSEUMS ARE THINGS LIKE THE FRICK MUSEUM IN NEW YORK AND THE HUNTINGTON HARTFORD IN PASADENA WHERE IT’S SOMEONE’S HOME THAT YOU WALK THROUGH. HOME AND GARDEN IN THE CASE OF THE HUNTINGTON HARTFORD AND YOU SEE THE ART IN A VERY COMFORTABLE, NATURAL SETTING ON A MUCH SMALLER, MORE HUMAN SCALE. SO I’M GOING TO START THESE ART MUSEUMS THAT ARE BASICALLY CONVERTED HOMES AND I HAVE ONE FOR MODERN ART, AND I HAVE ONE FOR 19TH CENTURY EUROPEAN ART, AND ONE FOR FRENCH IMPRESSIONISM. I’VE GOT JAPANESE. I OWN A HOME IN KYOTO, JAPAN ACTUALLY ON THE TEMPLE ON GROUNDS IN NANZENJI THAT IS GOING TO BECOME A JAPANESE ART MUSEUM. SO, A LOT OF THEM ARE MUSEUMS.
 I LOVE HAWAII AND LANAI IS A VERY INTERESTING PROJECT. THERE, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS TURN LANAI INTO A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS – AND LANAI, I OWN THE WATER UTILITY, I OWN THE ELECTRIC UTILITY AND THE ELECTRIC UTILITY IS ALL GOING TO BE SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC AND SOLAR THERMAL WHERE IT CAN CONVERT SEA WATER INTO FRESH WATER. AND THEN WE HAVE DRIP IRRIGATION WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ORGANIC FARMS ALL OVER THE ISLAND. HOPEFULLY WE ARE GOING TO EXPORT PRODUCE – REALLY THE BEST, ORGANIC PRODUCE TO JAPAN AND ELSEWHERE. AND THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS, WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL PEOPLE AND HELP THEM START THESE BUSINESSES. WE WILL HAVE ELECTRIC CARS. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE, IF YOU WILL, LABORATORY FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN BUSINESSES OF SMALL SCALE
WELL ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, MY ACCOUNTANTS – I DON’T OWE 4.2 BILLION DOLLARS OR EVEN A BILLION DOLLARS. IT TURNS OUT THAT I DO HAVE A CREDIT LINE WHERE LETS SAY IF I WANTED TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS, I COULD GO BUY THE LOS ANGELES LAKERS. THEY ARE NOT FOR SALE, BUT –
 IT IS EXTRAORDINARY. YOU KNOW STEVE AND I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS A LOT AND I THINK BOTH OF US AGREED THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU STOP AND THINK ABOUT IT, BUT 99.99 PERCENT OF THE TIME YOU JUST KIND OF GET ON WITH THE MIRACLE OF LIFE. YOU KNOW, JUST BEING ALIVE EVERY DAY AND GOING OUT AND DOING YOUR JOB AND ENJOYING BEING ALIVE. I REALLY DON’T’ SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT WOW, LOOK HOW FAR I’VE COME FROM THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN – NOT THE BRONX BY THE WAY.

WELL THE INTERNET ISN’T ALWAYS 100 PERCENT ACCURATE, BUT I THINK MAYBE SOMEONE WAS BOASTING ABOUT MY FAMILY’S GREAT WEALTH CLAIMING WE CAME FROM THE BRONX WHEN REALLY IT WAS THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN. THE ONLY WORSE NEIGHBORHOOD IN NEW YORK THAN THE BRONX.
WELL AGAIN, I THINK ORACLE. I GUESS MY TOP PRIORITY IS MY FAMILY AND MY SECOND PRIORITY WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, MY JOB. AND MY JOB REALLY IS AT ORACLE. ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF – WHETHER IT’S A MUSEUM, OR ARCHITECTURE OR FLYING AIRPLANES OR RACING SAILBOATS, IS KIND OF AN INTENSE HOBBY. SOMEONE DESCRIBED MY HOBBIES AS MY PURSUIT OF ALTERNATIVE STRESS. AND SO I LOVE TO COMPETE IN BUSINESS AND ALL OF MY HOBBIES I’M FAIRLY COMPETITIVE AS WELL.


THANK YOU, MARIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
