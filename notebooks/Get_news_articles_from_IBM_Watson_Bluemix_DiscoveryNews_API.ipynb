Udacity was founded by Sebastian Thrun, who started Google\\u2019s self-driving vehicle program and has been one of the field\\u2019s biggest names for 10 years.\\n\\nThrun won\\u2019t join Voyage. But it will be led by Oliver Cameron, Udacity\\u2019s vice president of engineering. He announced the company\\u2019s formation Wednesday on social media, following a report on Voyage in Business Insider.\\n\\nRELATED\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re deploying autonomous taxis to real users very, very soon,\\u201d Cameron wrote on his Facebook and LinkedIn pages. According to Voyage\\u2019s LinkedIn page, the startup has four employees, Cameron included.\\n\\nOther, more established companies are pursuing the same goal.\\n\\nUber has been testing robotic taxis (with humans behind the steering wheel) in Pittsburgh. Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields committed his company last year to building autonomous taxis by 2021. Electric-auto maker Tesla also plans a fleet of self-driving cars that can be hailed for rides.\\n\\nVoyage will focus on retrofitting cars with self-driving technology rather than designing and building its own car from scratch.\\n\\nUdacity already has a self-driving car created as part of its programming course, which now has 6,600 students worldwide. But Udacity executives told Business Insider that Voyage won\\u2019t use technology developed by Udacity students.\\n\\nThrun told Business Insider he isn\\u2019t taking part in the new company because of \\u201cpersonal conflicts.\\u201d\\n\\nA Udacity spokeswoman declined to say Thursday what those conflicts are. But the self-driving industry has seen at least two lawsuits recently over high-profile engineers leaving one company to start another.\\n\\n\\u201cWishing Oliver and his team all of the best!\\u201d Thrun wrote Wednesday night on Facebook.\\n\\n\\u00a92017 the San Francisco Chronicle Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\\n\\nRELATED\\n\\nOUR NETWORK\\n\\n\",\n",

But it will be led by Oliver Cameron, Udacity\\u2019s vice president of engineering. He announced the company\\u2019s formation Wednesday on social media, following a report on Voyage in Business Insider.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re deploying autonomous taxis to real users very, very soon,\\u201d Cameron wrote on his Facebook and LinkedIn pages. According to Voyage\\u2019s LinkedIn page, the startup has four employees, Cameron included.\\nOther, more established companies are pursuing the same goal.\\nUber has been testing robotic taxis (with humans behind the steering wheel) in Pittsburgh. Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields committed his company last year to building autonomous taxis by 2021. Electric-auto maker Tesla also plans a fleet of self-driving cars that can be hailed for rides.\\nVoyage will focus on retrofitting cars with self-driving technology rather than designing and building its own car from scratch.\\nUdacity already has a self-driving car created as part of its programming course, which now has 6,600 students worldwide. But Udacity executives told Business Insider that Voyage won\\u2019t use technology developed by Udacity students.\\nThrun told Business Insider he isn\\u2019t taking part in the new company because of \\u201cpersonal conflicts.\\u201d\\nA Udacity spokeswoman declined to say Thursday what those conflicts are. But the self-driving industry has seen at least two lawsuits recently over high-profile engineers leaving one company to start another.\\n\\u201cWishing Oliver and his team all of the best!\\u201d Thrun wrote Wednesday night on Facebook.\\nWe invite you to discuss and comment on this article using social media.\\nScan the day\\u2019s headlines, as well as original and breaking technology news for state and local government readers.\\n\",\n",

It\\u2019s how things work in the physical world: You pay for a good or service.\\n\\nBut on the internet, not so much. Companies like Facebook and Google can sell your data and attention to advertisers, which supports the free services we use everyday. You\\u2019re still paying for the service, but you just don\\u2019t need your credit card.\\n\\nUber drivers are using this trick to make sure the company doesn\\u2019t underpay them\\n\\nOliver Cameron, CEO of self-driving taxi startup Voyage, suggested last night on Twitter that his company would pursue a similar model, where transportation is free or exceedingly cheap\\u2014and then hedged on whether he was pursuing an ad-supported model.\\n\\nThe Glomar Response came when Cameron responded to a Twitter user asking how Voyage intended to offer its ride-sharing service for free. Observe the Tweeters in their natural habitat:\\n\\nA fantastical new world of high-tech, high-concept stores is here\\n\\n\\u2014 Oliver Cameron (@olivercameron) April 13, 2017\\n\\n@olivercameron @voyage Hmmm ad supported? If so.. sign me up! Haha.\\n\\n\\u2014 Kristen (@TheSEADProject) April 13, 2017\\n\\n@TheSEADProject @voyage Can neither confirm or deny!\\n\\n\\u2014 Oliver Cameron (@olivercameron) April 13, 2017\\n\\nAt least anecdotally, the Glomar Response is used when someone wants to acknowledge the truth but cannot explicitly do so.\\n\\nCameron also revealed some of the ride-sharing app\\u2019s functionality, like controlling the AC and music in the car. While the car will have a driver, Cameron previously told Quartz that Voyage doesn\\u2019t want customers getting used to having someone there, in anticipation for looser regulations that don\\u2019t require a safety driver.\\n\\nCameron declined to share more information, but added, \\u201cFree transportation would fundamentally change where and how people live though, wouldn\\u2019t it?\\u201d\\n\\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\\u2019s most important and interesting news.\\n\\nMore stories from Quartz:\\n\\nWhat to read next\\n\\nYahoo Finance UK\\n\\nBusiness Insider\\n\\nFortune\\n\\nAssociated Press\\n\\nPR Newswire\\n\\nAssociated Press\\n\\nValuePenguin\\n\\nAFP News\\n\\nAssociated Press\\n\\nProperty Guru\\n\\nReuters\\n\\n\",\n",

Companies like Facebook and Google can sell your data and attention to advertisers, which supports the free services we use everyday. You\\u2019re still paying for the service, but you just don\\u2019t need your credit card.\\nOliver Cameron, CEO of self-driving taxi startup Voyage, suggested last night on Twitter that his company would pursue a similar model, where transportation is free or exceedingly cheap\\u2014and then hedged on whether he was pursuing an ad-supported model.\\nThe Glomar Response came when Cameron responded to a Twitter user asking how Voyage intended to offer its ride-sharing service for free. Observe the Tweeters in their natural habitat:\\nAt least anecdotally, the Glomar Response is used when someone wants to acknowledge the truth but cannot explicitly do so.\\nCameron also revealed some of the ride-sharing app\\u2019s functionality, like controlling the AC and music in the car. While the car will have a driver, Cameron previously told Quartz that Voyage doesn\\u2019t want customers getting used to having someone there, in anticipation for looser regulations that don\\u2019t require a safety driver.\\nCameron declined to share more information, but added, \\u201cFree transportation would fundamentally change where and how people live though, wouldn\\u2019t it?\\u201d\\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\\u2019s most important and interesting news.\\nMore stories from Quartz:\\n\",\n",

Voyage will focus on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis using retrofitted mass-production automobiles rather than building and selling its own autonomous car.\\n\\nAnd it's doing more than just creating a car that can drive itself \\u2014 Voyage wants passengers to control the whole experience.\\n\\nThe new spin-out will be lead by Oliver Cameron, a Udacity VP that was spearheading a lot of its self-driving car curriculum. The company broke the news to its employees Wednesday morning.\\n\\nUdacity will have a stake in the newly-formed company as part of the deal, said the Udacity's CMO Shernaz Daver. Voyage also recently closed a seed round of funding that included Khosla Ventures, Initialized Capital, and Charles River Ventures.\\n\\nVoyage has been hot in Silicon Valley investor circles because of one big name linked to Udacity: Sebastian Thrun. Thrun, who founded the education startup, is also nicknamed the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for the work he did at Google and helped launch the self-driving car nanodegree program at Udacity.\\n\\nThrun, though, says he'll have no connection with Voyage even though it's spinning out of his company. \\\"Because of personal conflicts, I have excused myself from any involvement in Voyage. I wish Oliver and his team all the best,\\\" Thrun said in a statement to Business Insider.\\n\\nThe autonomous taxi startup wants to bring about the end goal where autonomous cars can carry people anywhere for a very low cost, Cameron said. It already has permission to deploy its self-driving cars to ferry passengers in a few places over the next few months, but Cameron declined to specify where.\\n\\n\\\"We want to deploy these not within five years, but very soon. We think in terms of weeks, not in terms of years or months,\\\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\\n\\nThe new kids on the block\\n\\nCameron and most of Voyage's team had been at Udacity working on its open-sourced self-driving car project.\\n\\nThis fall, Udacity's open-sourced self-driving car hit a big milestone for the company. The car drove itself 31 miles up El Camino Real, a busy thoroughfare in the Bay Area, through 140 stoplights, a myriad of crosswalks, and crazy pedestrians during the hour-and-a-half drive.\\n\\nIt was one of the best days of his career, Cameron said, and he realized he also wanted to be building a business out of it.\\n\\nDespite being a spin-out, Voyage will not be using any of the technology that Udacity's students have built, said Udacity's CMO Daver.\\n\\nInstead, it's retrofitting other vehicles, purchasing the necessary sensors, and building software so they can drive themselves. But beyond just the self-driving tech, Voyage will be concentrating on building out the whole experience of being in an autonomous taxi.\\n\\nUber's self-driving car\\n\\n(Business Insider/Corey Protin)\\n\\nWhile there has to be a safety driver in the autonomous taxis for now, Voyage wants the passengers to use voice controls to do everything from changing the music to instruct the car to begin and stop its journey.\\n\\nCreating a startup designed to ferry people from point-to-point sounds exactly what Uber is trying to accomplish, down to retrofitting other vehicles rather than building its own from scratch. Cameron doesn't want to address Uber specifically, but he's aware that there are plenty of big-name, well-funded incumbents in the space.\\n\\nCameron thinks Voyage's approach of building a product, the whole Voyage experience, and not just the technology will be able to separate it from the rest. And there's no guarantee Uber has a lock on the field.\\n\\nIn the US, only 30% of adults have used a ride-hailing app like Uber, according to a recent survey from Statista. That means Uber hasn't won the market by default yet, and Cameron thinks that Voyage could just be one of many options for people to get around easily and at a low cost in the future.\\n\\n\\\"What we believe in is that an autonomous taxi can be cheap,\\\" Camerson said.\\n\\nTop 3\\n\\nTech\\n\\n\",\n",

That means Uber hasn't won the market by default yet, and Cameron thinks that Voyage could just be one of many options for people to get around easily and at a low cost in the future. \\n\\\"What we believe in is that an autonomous taxi can be cheap,\\\" Camerson said.\\n\",\n",

Voyage will focus on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis using retrofitted mass-production automobiles rather than building and selling its own autonomous car.\\n\\nAnd it's doing more than just creating a car that can drive itself - Voyage wants passengers to control the whole experience.\\n\\nThe new spin-out will be lead by Oliver Cameron , a Udacity VP that was spearheading a lot of its self-driving car curriculum. The company broke the news to its employees Wednesday morning.\\n\\nUdacity will have a stake in the newly-formed company as part of the deal, said the Udacity's CMO Shernaz Daver. Voyage also recently closed a seed round of funding that included Khosla Ventures, Initialized Capital, and Charles River Ventures.\\n\\nVoyage has been hot in Silicon Valley investor circles because of one big name linked to Udacity: Sebastian Thrun. Thrun, who founded the education startup, is also nicknamed the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for the work he did at Google and helped launch the self-driving car nanodegree program at Udacity .\\n\\nThrun, though, says he'll have no connection with Voyage even though it's spinning out of his company. \\\" Because of personal conflicts, I have excused myself from any involvement in Voyage. I wish Oliver and his team all the best,\\\" Thrun said in a statement to Business Insider.\\n\\nThe autonomous taxi startup wants to bring about the end goal where autonomous cars can carry people anywhere for a very low cost, Cameron said. It already has permission to deploy its self-driving cars to ferry passengers in a few places over the next few months, but Cameron declined to specify where.\\n\\n\\\"We want to deploy these not within five years, but very soon. We think in terms of weeks, not in terms of years or months,\\\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\\n\\nThe new kids on the block\\n\\nCameron and most of Voyage's team had been at Udacity working on its open-sourced self-driving car project.\\n\\nThis fall, Udacity's open-sourced self-driving car hit a big milestone for the company. The car drove itself 31 miles up El Camino Real, a busy thoroughfare in the Bay Area, through 140 stoplights, a myriad of crosswalks, and crazy pedestrians during the hour-and-a-half drive.\\n\\nIt was one of the best days of his career, Cameron said, and he realized he also wanted to be building a business out of it.\\n\\nDespite being a spin-out, Voyage will not be using any of the technology that Udacity's students have built, said Udacity's CMO Daver.\\n\\nInstead, it's retrofitting other vehicles, purchasing the necessary sensors, and building software so they can drive themselves. But beyond just the self-driving tech, Voyage will be concentrating on building out the whole experience of being in an autonomous taxi.\\n\\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\\n\\nUber's self-driving car\\n\\n\\\"When you step into a Voyage car, you don't just say 'Hey, safety driver,'\\\" Camerson said. \\\"All you do is say 'Begin Voyage.' We're building the experience to assume you're the driver.\\\"\\n\\nWhile there has to be a safety driver in the autonomous taxis for now, Voyage wants the passengers to use voice controls to do everything from changing the music to instruct the car to begin and stop its journey.\\n\\nCreating a startup designed to ferry people from point-to-point sounds exactly what Uber is trying to accomplish, down to retrofitting other vehicles rather than building its own from scratch. Cameron doesn't want to address Uber specifically, but he's aware that there are plenty of big-name, well-funded incumbents in the space.\\n\\nCameron thinks Voyage's approach of building a product, the whole Voyage experience, and not just the technology will be able to separate it from the rest. And there's no guarantee Uber has a lock on the field.\\n\\nIn the US, only 30% of adults have used a ride-hailing app like Uber, according to a recent survey from Statista. That means Uber hasn't won the market by default yet, and Cameron thinks that Voyage could just be one of many options for people to get around easily and at a low cost in the future.\\n\\n\\\"What we believe in is that an autonomous taxi can be cheap,\\\" Camerson said.\\n\\nMore from this author\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nMore :\\n\\nPromoted Stories\\n\\nExclusive US NRI payment plan.

Voyage wants to put self-driving cars on the road as part of a fleet of taxis, created using retrofits to existing vehicles that add autonomous capabilities without requiring ground-up vehicle creation.\\n\\nThe task Voyage sets for itself is nonetheless incredibly ambitious: The company wants to operate its own self-driving service entirely, including creating the ride hailing platform through which it\\u2019ll operate, and providing a unique product that relies heavily on voice input from the driver to get the ride going, control music and make stops, reports Business Insider. Voyage sees its customers as \\u201cdrivers\\u201d in the sense that they\\u2019re in control of the in-vehicle experience, even if the vehicle is driving itself.\\n\\nVoyage wants to get its cars working in a commercial capacity sooner, rather than later. The startup is looking at fielding vehicles \\u201cvery soon,\\u201d according to the Insider report, and has already secured permission to start operating test vehicles with passenger trials sometime in the next few months, though it\\u2019s not discussing specific spots just yet.\\n\\nVoyage will enter a busy space with tough competitors, including Uber and Ford, who have a lot of road experience already under their belts.

Voyage wants to put self-driving cars on the road as part of a fleet of taxis, created using retrofits to existing vehicles that add autonomous capabilities without requiring ground-up vehicle creation.\\n The task Voyage sets for itself is nonetheless incredibly ambitious: The company wants to operate its own self-driving service entirely, including creating the ride hailing platform through which\\u00a0it\\u2019ll operate, and providing a unique product that relies heavily on voice input from the driver to get the ride going, control music and make stops, reports Business Insider. Voyage sees its customers as \\u201cdrivers\\u201d in the sense that they\\u2019re in control of the in-vehicle experience, even if the vehicle is driving itself.\\n Voyage wants to get its cars working in a commercial capacity sooner, rather than later. The startup is looking at fielding vehicles \\u201cvery soon,\\u201d according to the Insider report, and has already secured permission to start operating test vehicles with passenger trials sometime in the next few months, though it\\u2019s not discussing specific spots just yet.\\n Voyage will enter a busy space with tough competitors, including Uber and Ford, who have a lot of road experience already under their belts. The company also isn\\u2019t taking any of the tech developed by Udacity students via its self-driving program with it, according to Udacity, and Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun said that he\\u2019s keeping his distance from any of Voyage\\u2019s activities because of conflicts related to his prior role at Google\\u2019s self-driving car program.\\n\\n\\n Udacity provided the following statement regarding Voyage\\u2019s debut via a spokesperson:\\n Our Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program has seen strong demand with over 6,600 students enrolled worldwide and 24 hiring partners including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nvidia and Delphi among others.

Voyage will focus on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis using retrofitted mass-production automobiles rather than building and selling its own autonomous car.\\n\\nAnd it's doing more than just creating a car that can drive itself \\u2014 Voyage wants passengers to control the whole experience.\\n\\nThe new spin-out will be lead by Oliver Cameron, a Udacity VP that was spearheading a lot of its self-driving car curriculum. The company broke the news to its employees Wednesday morning.\\n\\nUdacity will have a stake in the newly-formed company as part of the deal, said Udacity's CMO Shernaz Daver. Voyage also recently closed a seed round of funding that included Khosla Ventures, Initialized Capital, and Charles River Ventures.\\n\\nVoyage has been hot in Silicon Valley investor circles because of one big name linked to Udacity: Sebastian Thrun. Thrun, who founded the education startup, is also nicknamed the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for the work he did at Google and helped launch the self-driving car nanodegree program at Udacity.\\n\\nThrun, though, says he'll have no connection with Voyage even though it's spinning out of his company. \\\"Because of personal conflicts, I have excused myself from any involvement in Voyage. I wish Oliver and his team all the best,\\\" Thrun said in a statement to Business Insider.\\n\\nThe autonomous taxi startup wants to bring about the end goal where autonomous cars can carry people anywhere for a very low cost, Cameron said. It already has permission to deploy its self-driving cars to ferry passengers in a few places over the next few months, but Cameron declined to specify where.\\n\\n\\\"We want to deploy these not within five years, but very soon. We think in terms of weeks, not in terms of years or months,\\\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\\n\\nThe new kids on the block\\n\\nCameron and most of Voyage's team had been at Udacity working on its open-sourced self-driving car project.\\n\\nThis fall, Udacity's open-sourced self-driving car hit a big milestone for the company. The car drove itself 31 miles up El Camino Real, a busy thoroughfare in the Bay Area, through 140 stoplights, a myriad of crosswalks, and crazy pedestrians during the hour-and-a-half drive.\\n\\nIt was one of the best days of his career, Cameron said, and he realized he also wanted to be building a business out of it.\\n\\nDespite being a spin-out, Voyage will not be using any of the technology that Udacity's students have built, said Udacity's CMO Daver.\\n\\nInstead, it's retrofitting other vehicles, purchasing the necessary sensors, and building software so they can drive themselves. But beyond just the self-driving tech, Voyage will be concentrating on building out the whole experience of being in an autonomous taxi.\\n\\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\\\"When you step into a Voyage car, you don\\u2019t just say 'Hey, safety driver,'\\\" Cameron said. \\\"All you do is say 'Begin Voyage.' We\\u2019re building the experience to assume you\\u2019re the driver.\\\"\\n\\nWhile there has to be a safety driver in the autonomous taxis for now, Voyage wants the passengers to use voice controls to do everything from changing the music to instruct the car to begin and stop its journey.\\n\\nCreating a startup designed to ferry people from point-to-point sounds exactly what Uber is trying to accomplish, down to retrofitting other vehicles rather than building its own from scratch. Cameron doesn't want to address Uber specifically, but he's aware that there are plenty of big-name, well-funded incumbents in the space.\\n\\nCameron thinks Voyage's approach of building a product, the whole Voyage experience, and not just the technology will be able to separate it from the rest. And there's no guarantee Uber has a lock on the field.\\n\\nIn the US, only 30% of adults have used a ride-hailing app like Uber, according to a recent survey from Statista. That means Uber hasn't won the market by default yet, and Cameron thinks that Voyage could just be one of many options for people to get around easily and at a low cost in the future.\\n\\n\\\"What we believe in is that an autonomous taxi can be cheap,\\\" Cameron said.\\n\\nJoin the conversation about this story \\u00bb\\n\\nSee Also:\\n\\nMost Popular\\n\\n1\\n\\nPolice identify man killed when car rolls over him\\n\\n2\\n\\nShoe discounter closing stores in Norwalk, Newtown\\n\\n3\\n\\nDriver killed in Woodbury crash\\n\\n4\\n\\nTractor trailer accident on I-84 snarls traffic\\n\\n5\\n\\nPolice: Motorcyclist fleeing traffic stop dies in crash\\n\\n6\\n\\nMan dies trying to eat doughnut in shop's eating challenge\\n\\n7\\n\\nSouthbury woman dies of injuries suffered in head-on collision\\n\\nIs your office awesome?\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nContact\\n\\nConnect\\n\\n\",\n",

      "      \"alchemyapi_text\": \" Six months ago, online education startup Udacity set out to train a new legion of self-driving car engineers.\\u00a0\\nThe school for robo-cars has been so successful that it's now spinning out of Udacity into its own company,\\u00a0Voyage.\\u00a0\\nThe self-driving car company will join a crowded market filled with heavyweights such as Google, Tesla, and Uber. Voyage will focus on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis using retrofitted mass-production automobiles\\u00a0rather than building and selling\\u00a0its own autonomous car.\\nAnd it's doing more than just creating a car that can drive itself \\u2014 Voyage wants passengers to control the whole experience.\\nThe new spin-out will be lead by Oliver Cameron, a Udacity VP that was spearheading a lot of its self-driving car curriculum. The company broke the news to its employees Wednesday morning.\\nUdacity will have a stake in the newly-formed company as part of the deal, said Udacity's\\u00a0CMO Shernaz Daver. Voyage also recently closed a seed round of funding that included Khosla Ventures, Initialized Capital, and Charles River Ventures.\\u00a0\\nVoyage has been hot in Silicon Valley investor circles because of one big name linked to Udacity: Sebastian Thrun. Thrun, who founded the education startup, is\\u00a0also nicknamed the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for the work he did at Google and helped launch the self-driving car nanodegree program at Udacity.\\u00a0\\nThrun, though, says he'll have no connection with Voyage even though it's spinning out of his company. \\\"Because of personal conflicts, I have excused myself from any involvement in Voyage. I wish Oliver and his team all the best,\\\" Thrun said in a statement to Business Insider.\\nThe autonomous taxi startup wants to bring about the end goal where autonomous cars can carry people anywhere for a very low cost, Cameron said. It already has permission to deploy its self-driving cars to ferry passengers in a few places over the next few months, but Cameron declined to specify where.\\n\\\"We want to deploy these not within five years, but very soon. We think in terms of weeks, not in terms of years or months,\\\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\\u00a0\\nThe new kids on the block\\nCameron and most of Voyage's team had been at Udacity working on its open-sourced self-driving car project.\\nThis fall, Udacity's open-sourced self-driving car hit a big milestone for the company. The car drove itself 31 miles up El Camino Real, a busy thoroughfare in the Bay Area, through 140 stoplights, a myriad of crosswalks, and crazy pedestrians during the hour-and-a-half drive.\\u00a0\\nIt was one of the best days of his career, Cameron said, and he\\u00a0realized he also wanted to be building a business out of it.\\nDespite being a spin-out, Voyage will not be using any of the technology that Udacity's students have built, said Udacity's CMO Daver.\\nInstead, it's retrofitting other vehicles, purchasing the necessary sensors, and building software so they can drive themselves. But beyond just the self-driving tech, Voyage will be concentrating on building out the whole experience of being in an autonomous taxi.\\u00a0\\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\\\"When you step into a Voyage car, you don\\u2019t just say 'Hey, safety driver,'\\\" Cameron said. \\\"All you do is say 'Begin Voyage.' We\\u2019re building the experience to assume you\\u2019re the driver.\\\"\\nWhile there has to be a safety driver in the autonomous taxis for now, Voyage wants the passengers to use\\u00a0voice controls to do everything from changing the music to instruct the car to begin and stop its journey.\\u00a0\\nCreating a startup designed to ferry people from point-to-point sounds exactly what Uber is trying to accomplish, down to retrofitting other vehicles rather than building its own from scratch. Cameron doesn't want to address Uber specifically, but he's aware that there are plenty of big-name, well-funded incumbents in the space.\\u00a0\\nCameron thinks Voyage's approach of building a product, the whole Voyage experience, and not just the technology will be able to separate it from the rest. And there's no guarantee Uber has a lock on the field.\\u00a0\\nIn the US, only 30% of adults have used a ride-hailing app like Uber, according to a recent survey from Statista. That means\\u00a0Uber hasn't won the market by default yet, and Cameron thinks that Voyage could just be one of many options for people to get around easily and at a low cost in the future.\\u00a0\\n\\\"What we believe in is that an autonomous taxi can be cheap,\\\" Cameron said.\\nNOW WATCH: Forget the iPhone 7 \\u2014 here are 13 reasons the next iPhone will blow everyone away\\nSee Also:\\nNOW READ:\\u00a0The stunning string of blows that have upended Uber, the world's most valuable startup\\n\",\n",

Led by CEO (and former Udacity Vice President) Oliver Cameron, the new spin-off company will be called Voyage and has given itself the goal of getting autonomous taxis to \\\"real users\\\" in less than five years.\\n\\nAs Cameron noted on Twitter, he thinks Voyage can hit that goal thanks to a \\\"maturing\\\" ecosystem that will allow the company to add autonomous functions to existing vehicles without needing to build a new self-driving car from the ground up. According to Business Insider, Voyage plans to differentiate itself from the competition at Uber and Lyft by allowing riders to control the experience with voice commands that set destination, add additional stops or simply control music playback. Although the company didn't specify which markets it would enter first, Voyage is aiming to start test rides with real passengers \\\"very soon\\\" -- possibly in the next few months.\\n\\n\\u26f5 Personal news! I'm starting a new thing with great friends called @voyage. We're deploying autonomous taxis to real users very, very soon. pic.twitter.com/aklKSUNMJR\\n\\n\\u2014 Oliver Cameron (@olivercameron) April 5, 2017\\n\\nUdacity founder Sebastian Thrun has been called the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for his early work on Google's self-driving project, but as TechCrunch reports, Udacity will be separate from Voyage moving forward. And Voyage won't be taking any of the self-driving tech developed by Udacity students along with it in order to avoid possible legal battles like the one currently brewing between Uber and Alphabet's Waymo. As for the rest of the competition, Voyage's timeline may not be the most aggressive we've seen: Ford plans to have a fully autonomous car and ride sharing service ready for the public by 2021, while Mercedes and Bosch hope to beat them to market with autonomous car-sharing before 2020. GM and Lyft's partnership, meanwhile, is reportedly working towards delivering an autonomous fleet as soon as 2018.\\n\\nAndrew Dalton wrote this article for Engadget.\\n\\nRelated Video:\\n\\nTrending\\n\\nFrom Our Partners\\n\\nYou May Like\\n\\nLinks by Zergnet\\n\\nShop Books\\n\\nParts & Accessories\\n\\nShop Merchandise\\n\\nShop Movies\\n\\n\\u00d7\\n\\nAdd New Alerts\\n\\nSigned in as Sign Out\\n\\nSelect one or more topics to subscribe to:\\n\\nGreen\\n\\nTransportation Alternatives\\n\\nEmerging Technologies\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAutonomous\\n\\nculture\\n\\ntaxis\\n\\ntransportation\\n\\nudacity\\n\\nvoyage\\n\\nSelect one or more of the following methods to receive alerts:\\n\\nThis phone number will be used for all of your alerts.

      "      \"alchemyapi_text\": \"Popular online learning service Udacity already trains engineers for work in the fast-growing autonomous vehicles field, but now the company is ready to harness all that talent and launch its own self-driving taxi company. Led by CEO (and former Udacity Vice President) Oliver Cameron, the new spin-off company will be called Voyage and has given itself the goal of getting autonomous taxis to \\\"real users\\\" in less than five years.\\nAs Cameron noted on Twitter, he thinks Voyage can hit that goal thanks to a \\\"maturing\\\" ecosystem that will allow the company to add autonomous functions to existing vehicles without needing to build a new self-driving car from the ground up. According to Business Insider, Voyage plans to differentiate itself from the competition at Uber and Lyft by allowing riders to control the experience with voice commands that set destination, add additional stops or simply control music playback. Although the company didn't specify which markets it would enter first, Voyage is aiming to start test rides with real passengers \\\"very soon\\\" -- possibly in the next few months.\\nUdacity founder Sebastian Thrun has been called the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for his early work on Google's self-driving project, but as TechCrunch reports, Udacity will be separate from Voyage moving forward. And Voyage won't be taking any of the self-driving tech developed by Udacity students along with it in order to avoid possible legal battles like the one currently brewing between Uber and Alphabet's Waymo. As for the rest of the competition, Voyage's timeline may not be the most aggressive we've seen: Ford plans to have a fully autonomous car and ride sharing service ready for the public by 2021, while Mercedes and Bosch hope to beat them to market with autonomous car-sharing before 2020. GM and Lyft's partnership, meanwhile, is reportedly working towards delivering an autonomous fleet as soon as 2018.\\n\",\n",

Led by CEO (and former Udacity Vice President) Oliver Cameron, the new spin-off company will be called Voyage and has given itself the goal of getting autonomous taxis to \\\"real users\\\" in less than five years.\\n\\nAs Cameron noted on Twitter, he thinks Voyage can hit that goal thanks to a \\\"maturing\\\" ecosystem that will allow the company to add autonomous functions to existing vehicles without needing to build a new self-driving car from the ground up. According to Business Insider, Voyage plans to differentiate itself from the competition at Uber and Lyft by allowing riders to control the experience with voice commands that set destination, add additional stops or simply control music playback. Although the company didn't specify which markets it would enter first, Voyage is aiming to start test rides with real passengers \\\"very soon\\\" -- possibly in the next few months.\\n\\n\\u26f5 Personal news!

And Voyage won't be taking any of the self-driving tech developed by Udacity students along with it in order to avoid possible legal battles like the one currently brewing between Uber and Alphabet's Waymo. As for the rest of the competition, Voyage's timeline may not be the most aggressive we've seen: Ford plans to have a fully autonomous car and ride sharing service ready for the public by 2021, while Mercedes and Bosch hope to beat them to market with autonomous car-sharing before 2020.

Voyage will focus on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis using retrofitted mass-production automobiles rather than building and selling its own autonomous car.\\n\\nAnd it's doing more than just creating a car that can drive itself - Voyage wants passengers to control the whole experience.\\n\\nThe new spin-out will be lead by Oliver Cameron , a Udacity VP that was spearheading a lot of its self-driving car curriculum. The company broke the news to its employees Wednesday morning.\\n\\nUdacity will have a stake in the newly-formed company as part of the deal, said the Udacity's CMO Shernaz Daver. Voyage also recently closed a seed round of funding that included Khosla Ventures, Initialized Capital, and Charles River Ventures.\\n\\nVoyage has been hot in Silicon Valley investor circles because of one big name linked to Udacity: Sebastian Thrun. Thrun, who founded the education startup, is also nicknamed the \\\"Godfather of self-driving cars\\\" for the work he did at Google and helped launch the self-driving car nanodegree program at Udacity .\\n\\nThrun, though, says he'll have no connection with Voyage even though it's spinning out of his company. \\\" Because of personal conflicts, I have excused myself from any involvement in Voyage. I wish Oliver and his team all the best,\\\" Thrun said in a statement to Business Insider.\\n\\nThe autonomous taxi startup wants to bring about the end goal where autonomous cars can carry people anywhere for a very low cost, Cameron said. It already has permission to deploy its self-driving cars to ferry passengers in a few places over the next few months, but Cameron declined to specify where.\\n\\n\\\"We want to deploy these not within five years, but very soon. We think in terms of weeks, not in terms of years or months,\\\" he told Business Insider in an interview.\\n\\nThe new kids on the block\\n\\nCameron and most of Voyage's team had been at Udacity working on its open-sourced self-driving car project.\\n\\nThis fall, Udacity's open-sourced self-driving car hit a big milestone for the company. The car drove itself 31 miles up El Camino Real, a busy thoroughfare in the Bay Area, through 140 stoplights, a myriad of crosswalks, and crazy pedestrians during the hour-and-a-half drive.\\n\\nIt was one of the best days of his career, Cameron said, and he realized he also wanted to be building a business out of it.\\n\\nDespite being a spin-out, Voyage will not be using any of the technology that Udacity's students have built, said Udacity's CMO Daver.\\n\\nInstead, it's retrofitting other vehicles, purchasing the necessary sensors, and building software so they can drive themselves. But beyond just the self-driving tech, Voyage will be concentrating on building out the whole experience of being in an autonomous taxi.\\n\\nBusiness Insider/Corey Protin\\n\\nUber's self-driving car\\n\\n\\\"When you step into a Voyage car, you don't just say 'Hey, safety driver,'\\\" Camerson said. \\\"All you do is say 'Begin Voyage.' We're building the experience to assume you're the driver.\\\"\\n\\nWhile there has to be a safety driver in the autonomous taxis for now, Voyage wants the passengers to use voice controls to do everything from changing the music to instruct the car to begin and stop its journey.\\n\\nCreating a startup designed to ferry people from point-to-point sounds exactly what Uber is trying to accomplish, down to retrofitting other vehicles rather than building its own from scratch. Cameron doesn't want to address Uber specifically, but he's aware that there are plenty of big-name, well-funded incumbents in the space.\\n\\nCameron thinks Voyage's approach of building a product, the whole Voyage experience, and not just the technology will be able to separate it from the rest. And there's no guarantee Uber has a lock on the field.\\n\\nIn the US, only 30% of adults have used a ride-hailing app like Uber, according to a recent survey from Statista. That means Uber hasn't won the market by default yet, and Cameron thinks that Voyage could just be one of many options for people to get around easily and at a low cost in the future.\\n\\n\\\"What we believe in is that an autonomous taxi can be cheap,\\\" Camerson said.\\n\\nMore from this author\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\nMore :\\n\\nPromoted Stories\\n\\nThe Most Addictive Game Of The Year!\\n\\nForge Of Empires - Free Online Game\\n\\nSee The Online Glasses Store That Has Retailers Worried\\n\\nGlassesUSA.com\\n\\nHiring a Handyman: The Best Solution for Your Small Home R..\\n\\nHomeAdvisor\\n\\nThe Most Addicting Shopping Site For Women\\n\\nTophatter\\n\\nSanta Clara: This Meal Service is Cheaper Than Your Local ..\\n\\nHome Chef\\n\\nWhy Is Quicken Loans Urging Americans Avoid 30-Year Mortga..\\n\\nQuickenLoans, NMLS #3030\\n\\nThe Youth Boardroom More\\n\\nThis is where the Youth tells the Govt what it can do to make their lives better\\n\\nvideo The problems Indian startups are facing\\n\\nRecommended Read\\n\\nA top LinkedIn exec shares his best career advice for 20-somethings\\n\\nThe top 10 tech companies that pay the most when poaching employees\\n\\nHere\\u2019s how much RBI governor Urjit Patel will earn now after salary hike\\n\\nThe best photos from 66 countries, according to the largest competition in the world\\n\\nBuzzing\\n\\nA photographer captured these dismal photos of life in North Korea on his phone\\n\\nMorgan Stanley made an error analyzing Snapchat, and it shines a light on some big flaws in Wall Street research\\n\\nSanta Clara, California: This Brilliant Company Is Disrupt..\\n\\nAd: EverQuote Insurance Quotes\\n\\nMeet the Instagram-famous travel blogging couple who get paid up to $9,000 to post a single photo\\n\\n15 sentences your interviewer doesn't want to hear\\n\\nSubscribe to latest stories\\n\\nHuffington Post\\n\\nLearn at Coursera\\n\\n\",\n",

Led by CEO (and former Udacity Vice President) Oliver Cameron, the new spin-off company will be called Voyage and has given itself the goal of getting autonomous taxis to \\\"real users\\\" in less than five years.\\n\\nAs Cameron noted on Twitter, he thinks Voyage can hit that goal thanks to a \\\"maturing\\\" ecosystem that will allow the company to add autonomous functions to existing vehicles without needing to build a new self-driving car from the ground up. According to Business Insider, Voyage plans to differentiate itself from the competition at Uber and Lyft by allowing riders to control the experience with voice commands that set destination, add additional stops or simply control music playback. Although the company didn't specify which markets it would enter first, Voyage is aiming to start test rides with real passengers \\\"very soon\\\" -- possibly in the next few months.\\n\\n\\u26f5 Personal news!

And Voyage won't be taking any of the self-driving tech developed by Udacity students along with it in order to avoid possible legal battles like the one currently brewing between Uber and Alphabet's Waymo. As for the rest of the competition, Voyage's timeline may not be the most aggressive we've seen: Ford plans to have a fully autonomous car and ride sharing service ready for the public by 2021, while Mercedes and Bosch hope to beat them to market with autonomous car-sharing before 2020. GM and Lyft's partnership, meanwhile, is reportedly working towards delivering an autonomous fleet as soon as 2018.\\n\\nAndrew Dalton wrote this article for Engadget.\\n\\nRelated Video:\\n\\nTrending\\n\\nFrom Our Partners\\n\\nYou May Like\\n\\nLinks by Zergnet\\n\\nShop Books\\n\\nParts & Accessories\\n\\nShop Merchandise\\n\\nShop Movies\\n\\n\\u00d7\\n\\nAdd New Alerts\\n\\nSigned in as Sign Out\\n\\nSelect one or more topics to subscribe to:\\n\\nGreen\\n\\nTransportation Alternatives\\n\\nEmerging Technologies\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nAutonomous\\n\\nculture\\n\\ntaxis\\n\\ntransportation\\n\\nudacity\\n\\nvoyage\\n\\nSelect one or more of the following methods to receive alerts:\\n\\nThis phone number will be used for all of your alerts.

Voyage wants to put self-driving cars on the road as part of a fleet of taxis, created using retrofits to existing vehicles that add autonomous capabilities without requiring ground-up vehicle creation.\\n\\nThe task Voyage sets for itself is nonetheless incredibly ambitious: The company wants to operate its own self-driving service entirely, including creating the ride hailing platform through which it\\u2019ll operate, and providing a unique product that relies heavily on voice input from the driver to get the ride going, control music and make stops, reports Business Insider. Voyage sees its customers as \\u201cdrivers\\u201d in the sense that they\\u2019re in control of the in-vehicle experience, even if the vehicle is driving itself.\\n\\nVoyage wants to get its cars working in a commercial capacity sooner, rather than later. The startup is looking at fielding vehicles \\u201cvery soon,\\u201d according to the Insider report, and has already secured permission to start operating test vehicles with passenger trials sometime in the next few months, though it\\u2019s not discussing specific spots just yet.\\n\\nVoyage will enter a busy space with tough competitors, including Uber and Ford, who have a lot of road experience already under their belts. The company also isn\\u2019t taking any of the tech developed by Udacity students via its self-driving program with it, according to Udacity, and Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun said that he\\u2019s keeping his distance from any of Voyage\\u2019s activities because of conflicts related to his prior role at Google\\u2019s self-driving car program.\\n\\nUdacity provided the following statement regarding Voyage\\u2019s debut via a spokesperson:\\n\\nOur Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program has seen strong demand with over 6,600 students enrolled worldwide and 24 hiring partners including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nvidia and Delphi among others. We are thrilled to have built a program of this calibre and have the ability to spin off a company in the self-driving space \\u2014 there is no better testimony for the program. We look forward to watching Voyage grow in this exciting space.\\n\\nLatest Crunch Report\\n\\nYahoo and AOL combine to become Oath Crunch Report\\n\\nPopular Posts\\n\\nFeatured Stories\\n\\nBoeing and ULA show off their emergency rocket rescue zipline\\n\\nSpaceX spent \\u2018less than half\\u2019 the cost of a new first stage on Falcon 9 relaunch\\n\\nUber finds one allegedly stolen Waymo file \\u2013 on an employee\\u2019s personal device\\n\\nGoogle says its custom machine learning chips are often 15-30x faster than GPUs and CPUs\\n\\nYouTube\\u2019s live TV streaming service goes live in five US cities for $35 per month\\n\\nLatest From TechCrunch\\n\\nTwitter launches a \\u2018lite\\u2019 mobile web app that\\u2019s optimized for emerging markets\\n\\nUber responds to the New York Times article about how it psychologically manipulates drivers\\n\\nAfrica Roundup: Google expands, 500 Startups tours, BRCK launches SupaBRCK\\n\\nTwitter ads starring Trump pop up in Tokyo train stations\\n\\nUp Next\\n\\nGM\\u2019s Maven car sharing service launches in Baltimore\\n\\nCrunchBoard\\n\\nJob Listings\\n\\nMore from CrunchBoard\\n\\n\",\n",

      "      \"alchemyapi_text\": \"    Udacity\\u2019s self-driving car program has been focused on training engineers and helping progress the field with open source contributions, but now Udacity Vice President Oliver Cameron is striking out with a new company called Voyage, which was born out of Udacity\\u2019s autonomous efforts. Voyage wants to put self-driving cars on the road as part of a fleet of taxis, created using retrofits to existing vehicles that add autonomous capabilities without requiring ground-up vehicle creation.\\n The task Voyage sets for itself is nonetheless incredibly ambitious: The company wants to operate its own self-driving service entirely, including creating the ride hailing platform through which\\u00a0it\\u2019ll operate, and providing a unique product that relies heavily on voice input from the driver to get the ride going, control music and make stops, reports Business Insider. Voyage sees its customers as \\u201cdrivers\\u201d in the sense that they\\u2019re in control of the in-vehicle experience, even if the vehicle is driving itself.\\n Voyage wants to get its cars working in a commercial capacity sooner, rather than later. The startup is looking at fielding vehicles \\u201cvery soon,\\u201d according to the Insider report, and has already secured permission to start operating test vehicles with passenger trials sometime in the next few months, though it\\u2019s not discussing specific spots just yet.\\n Voyage will enter a busy space with tough competitors, including Uber and Ford, who have a lot of road experience already under their belts. The company also isn\\u2019t taking any of the tech developed by Udacity students via its self-driving program with it, according to Udacity, and Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun said that he\\u2019s keeping his distance from any of Voyage\\u2019s activities because of conflicts related to his prior role at Google\\u2019s self-driving car program.\\n\\n\\n Udacity provided the following statement regarding Voyage\\u2019s debut via a spokesperson:\\n Our Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program has seen strong demand with over 6,600 students enrolled worldwide and 24 hiring partners including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nvidia and Delphi among others. We are thrilled to have built a program of this calibre and have the ability to spin off a company in the self-driving space \\u2014 there is no better testimony for the program. We look forward to watching Voyage grow in this exciting space.\\n    \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Udacity was founded by Sebastian Thrun, who started Google’s self-driving vehicle program and has been one of the field’s biggest names for 10 years.\\nThrun won’t join Voyage. But it will be led by Oliver Cameron, Udacity’s vice president of engineering. He announced the company’s formation Wednesday on social media, following a report on Voyage in Business Insider.\\n“We’re deploying autonomous taxis to real users very, very soon,” Cameron wrote on his Facebook and LinkedIn pages. According to Voyage’s LinkedIn page, the startup has four employees, Cameron included.\\nOther, more established companies are pursuing the same goal.\\nUber has been testing robotic taxis (with humans behind the steering wheel) in Pittsburgh. Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields committed his company last year to building autonomous taxis by 2021. Electric-auto maker Tesla also plans a fleet of self-driving cars that can be hailed for rides.\\nVoyage will focus on retrofitting cars with self-driving technology rather than designing and building its own car from scratch.\\nUdacity already has a self-driving car created as part of its programming course, which now has 6,600 students worldwide. But Udacity executives told Business Insider that Voyage won’t use technology developed by Udacity students.\\nThrun told Business Insider he isn’t taking part in the new company because of “personal conflicts.”\\nA Udacity spokeswoman declined to say Thursday what those conflicts are.

You’re still paying for the service, but you just don’t need your credit card.\\nOliver Cameron, CEO of self-driving taxi startup Voyage, suggested last night on Twitter that his company would pursue a similar model, where transportation is free or exceedingly cheap—and then hedged on whether he was pursuing an ad-supported model.\\nThe Glomar Response came when Cameron responded to a Twitter user asking how Voyage intended to offer its ride-sharing service for free.

Cameron doesn\\'t want to address Uber specifically, but he\\'s aware that there are plenty of big-name, well-funded incumbents in the space. \\nCameron thinks Voyage\\'s approach of building a product, the whole Voyage experience, and not just the technology will be able to separate it from the rest. And there\\'s no guarantee Uber has a lock on the field. \\nIn the US, only 30% of adults have used a ride-hailing app like Uber, according to a recent survey from Statista.

Updated to \"S\" specification in 2013, when it also received an upgraded V-12 engine, the Rapide soldiered on unchanged until 2017 and there weren’t many hints that Aston Martin is planning on doing something new anytime soon. However, the sedan was included in the new performance AMR program that the British firm launched at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.\\n\\nEssentially a high performance brand similar to Mercedes’ AMG and BMW’s M division, AMR is actually inspired by the Aston Martin Racing motorsport division and adds numerous bespoke features, as well as drivetrain upgrades. The AMR lineup will include two types of cars. There will be plain AMR models closely related to their road-going counterparts and AMR Pro cars with more extreme specs, including versions for track use only. The Rapide AMR concept is part of the former, being less aggressive than a track-prepped car but slotting above the regular model.\\n\\nAston Martin didn’t say how many of the features created for the show will make it to the production model, but it’s safe to assume that every single add-on will be made available to customers. Especially given the already high degree of customization you can get with standard models.\\n\\nContinue reading to learn more about the Aston Martin Rapide AMR concept\\n\\nWhat Makes the Aston Martin Rapide AMR Concept Special?\\n\\nThe race-inspired livery and the carbon-fiber trim make the AMR stand out compared to the standard Rapide\\n\\nA quick glance at the Rapide AMR is enough to notice that this is no regular model. Not only finished in an Aston Martin Racing-inspired livery metallic Stirling Green with yellowish, lime green stripes and accents, the Rapide AMR is also fitted with a range of bespoke exterior features that give it a more menacing stance.\\n\\nThe front fascia has \"race car\" written all over it thanks to the black, honeycomb grille instead of the usual horizontal slats and the heavily redesigned bumper. While the standard model has a clean apron section with a small opening under the grille, the AMR package adds a new, sportier element that includes the lower section and the foglamps. Made from carbon-fiber in a gloss finish, it also includes a splitter with lime green accents.\\n\\nThe lime green and carbon-fiber theme continues inside the cabin\\n\\nMoving onto the sides, we can see carbon-fiber side skirts with the same lime green stripe, blacked-out front fender vents and door handles, carbon-fiber mirror caps, and 21-inch, matte black alloys wheels. The rear is just as menacing, featuring a new, carbon-fiber diffuser with line green detailing, revised exhaust pipes, and a new aero flip on the deck lid. Paired with the race-inspired livery, all these upgrades look gorgeous and give the Rapide the aggressive stance it deserves.\\n\\nThe interior also received a lot of attention. The center stack and console casings, and some door elements are made from carbon-fiber, while the steering wheel and much of the trim is wrapped in Dark Knight Alcantara. Lime green accents add a dash of color to the center stack and the carbon-fiber seats, which also feature green \"AMR\" lettering. And something tells me that Aston Martin can offer even more bespoke features.\\n\\nThe V-12 engine packs an extra 40 horsepower\\n\\nUnder the hood, the naturally aspirated, 6.0-liter V-12 engine was upgraded to generate 592 horsepower, a 40-horsepower increase over the regular sedan. Already pretty quick with a standard 0-to-62 mph time of 4.4 seconds, the Rapide should be able to hit the benchmark in 4.3 ticks in AMR spec. Also, top speed increased from 203 to a whopping 210 mph. The drivetrain package is rounded off by a new exhaust system that gives the Rapide AMR a unique growl.\\n\\nNeedless to say, Aston Martin finally has what it takes to compete with Mercedes-AMG and BMW M sedans.\\n\\nPress Release\\n\\nAston Martin has chosen the 2017 Geneva Motor Show to launch AMR - an exciting new brand that brings a new dimension of race inspired dynamism and performance.\\n\\nReflecting Aston Martin’s racing pedigree, AMR takes technology and inspiration from motorsport to amplify the sporting prowess present across the model range. With enhanced performance, sharper dynamics and more powerful design language, AMR takes Aston Martin’s road cars to new and exciting extremes.\\n\\nThe AMR brand follows in the wheeltracks of successive iconic Aston Martin road cars which boasted top-level racing pedigree. In the mid-1930s the success of Aston Martin’s Team Cars in the Ulster TT road race led the marque to build further examples of the lightweight two-seater for sale to the public. In 1951, Sir David Brown introduced uprated and highly desirable ‘Vantage’ specification models, and steered the marque to an historic outright win at Le Mans with the iconic DBR1 in 1959.\\n\\nSince the formation of Aston Martin Racing (AMR) in 2004 Aston Martin has enjoyed success in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), winning the 2016 FIA WEC GT Drivers Championship, while also securing three class victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans over this period. Similarly, Aston Martin Racing’s GT3 and GT4 racers have secured countless victories and championship titles around the world.\\n\\nTwo AMR concepts have been unveiled in Geneva: The Rapide AMR and Vantage AMR Pro. The Rapide represents the first tier of AMR, enhancing the four-door sports car with a comprehensive suite of power, chassis and styling upgrades, plus a spectacular new interior treatment. The Vantage AMR Pro - heavily influenced by Aston Martin Racing’s WEC winning V8 Vantage GTE - is the pinnacle; an uncompromising demonstration of AMR’s ‘Track to Tarmac’ philosophy whereby race technology is transferred to road cars.\\n\\nWhile future development of the core AMR models will be part of Aston Martin’s central vehicle engineering teams, development of all AMR Pro models will be led by Q by Aston Martin Advanced Operations. This highly-skilled department - managed by Aston Martin’s VP and Chief Special Operations Officer, David King - already has extensive experience of creating extreme Aston Martins, with recent projects including the Vantage GT12, Vantage GT8 and Aston Martin Vulcan.\\n\\nUnderlining Aston Martin’s commitment to its new high-performance brand, AMR’s European development and brand centre will be based at Aston Martin’s state-of-the-art Nürburgring Test Centre, which is situated within sight of the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife race track.\\n\\nMarek Reichman, Aston Martin EVP and Chief Creative Officer, says that the AMR brand was a logical next step after the ’sold-out’ success of limited edition sporting versions like the Vantage GT8 and Vantage GT12: “Each time we have pushed the boundaries and done something extreme, the customers have loved the cars. AMR enables us to take Aston Martin into a new dimension. One where we can turn-up the sporting DNA present in all of our models and make a true statement. An AMR model will have an instantly recognisable design language. One that accentuates and amplifies, together with the latest GT race car technology for the road. They will be special and rare cars that are credible, thrilling to drive and hugely desirable to own.”\\n\\nRapide AMR\\n\\nA striking presence on the Aston Martin stand, the Rapide AMR provides a dynamic and visual blueprint for future AMR models. Featuring a 600PS version of Aston Martin’s celebrated 6.0-litre naturally aspirated V12 breathing through a new quad exhaust system, it is the world’s fastest and most thrilling four-door, capable of 210MPH. Resplendent in AMR’s signature Stirling Green with vibrant lime green accents, riding on new 21in alloy wheels and featuring a dramatic new full height signature grille, front splitter, side sills, rear diffuser and aero flip on the rear decklid, the Rapide AMR makes a striking statement.\\n\\nExtensive use of carbon fibre detailing on the exterior provide the perfect finishing touches. The interior is equally breathtaking. Lightweight carbon fibre front seats, trimmed throughout in Dark Knight Alcantara with Lime Green accents and carbon fibre waterfall, centre console and door casings, ensure the Rapide AMR is a fabulous fusion of race car attitude with a luxurious crafted twist.\\n\\nWhat is your take?\\n\\nSimilar cars\\n\\nLatest Models:\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\n',\n",

Now human rights campaigners are trying to shift attitudes in Egyptian society\\n\\nDefendants celebrate the acquittal in January 2015 of 26 men accused of ‘debauchery’ after they were arrested in a night-time raid on a Cairo bathhouse. Photograph: Mohamed El-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nJailed for using Grindr: homosexuality in Egypt\\n\\nPolice are using technology and ancient laws to imprison gay people. Now human rights campaigners are trying to shift attitudes in Egyptian society\\n\\nMia Janckowizc\\n\\nMonday 3 April 2017 05.50 EDT\\n\\nThe last time Egyptian engineering student Shady Ragab tried to visit his friend Andrew Medhat in prison, he was turned away.\\n\\n“We begged them … we just wanted to wish him a happy Easter. They wouldn’t even give him the food we brought to him,” said Ragab, who is Muslim, but had long enjoyed celebrating Christian festivals with his friend. Shady isn’t even sure if Medhat was even informed of the visit. That was a year ago; Ragab hasn’t seen him since. He wells up in tears as he relates the story.\\n\\nRagab and Medhat had met at university a few years earlier, building enough trust along with two other friends to open up and discuss their homosexuality together. But in March 2016 Medhat was sentenced to three years in prison for “public debauchery” and prostitution. Earlier that year, he had sent nude photographs of himself to another man on Grindr and had set up a time to meet in Tahrir Square. It was only when he was arrested on the way that he realised that his “date” was in fact an undercover policeman.\\n\\nHomosexuality is not illegal in Egypt. But in the late 1990s, the police stepped up the use of two old laws – a 1950 anti-prostitution law and a 1961 law against “debauchery” – to arrest and charge the practising LGBT community. The highest-profile action was a raid in Cairo in 2001 on the Queen Boat, a gay-friendly club on the Nile, where 52 men were arrested.\\n\\nWhy LGBT hatred suddenly spiked in Indonesia\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nAt the end of 2013, soon after the ousting of the democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi and as the military authors of the coup intensified their grip on power, LGBT campaigners noticed a new, powerful crackdown. The police – who operated hand-in-hand with the military – began a new round of arrests. And this time they were using new techniques.\\n\\n“The [police] are now more technologically advanced,” says Dalia Abdel Hameed, head of the gender programme at Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), describing their use of apps like Grindr to gather photographic “evidence,” arrange meetings, and entrap men. Medhat’s arrest, detention and imprisonment is remarkably similar to EIPR’s description of a typical process.\\n\\nOnce Medhat was under arrest, the police told his parents that he had taken money and that he had been arrested having sex in a flat, according to Ragab. Both claims allow the police to make a prostitution and debauchery case. He was detained in an underground cell in al-Qasr al Aini police station, five minutes’ walk from Tahrir Square. “The interrogation is the worst part,” says Abdel Hameed.\\n\\nAccording to Amr Abdel Rahman, a legal professor at the American University in Cairo and head of the civil liberties programme at EIPR, it is in the detention cells, with less surveillance than in prison itself, that the detainee is particularly vulnerable to both the cellmates and the interrogators. At worst, says Abdel Rahman, scientifically dubious anal examination is made on male detainees in order to produce evidence that they have engaged in homosexual activity – even when the supposed marks of this are often so fresh that it can only be the result of rape within detention.\\n\\nThere are reasons to be cheerful ... LGBTI rights gains in unlikely countries Peter Tatchell\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nLegal help and support becomes another cloudy issue. Legal expertise is available from LGBT groups. But the public stigma of the accusation often results in families making a knee-jerk decision to take the most conventional legal option a lawyer recommended by the police. Whether the family supports their child or not, associating with rights organisations can seem too much like a public statement. Abdel Rahman concurs. “If you present yourself in a respectable manner to the families as human rights lawyers, they say to themselves ‘now we are even making the case much harder for our kid’.”\\n\\nIn Medhat’s case, his family chose to take the lawyer recommended by the police. But this legal representation often falls horribly short of what is necessary. EIPR has documented numerous cases in which the police-recommended lawyer, who in Medhat’s case took 2,000EGP (£90) just to look at the case, does not act in the defendant’s best interests. Medhat’s lawyer, contrary to the advice of a lawyer from an LGBT group, advised Medhat to plead guilty to prostitution. The lawyer did not even show up in court. Ragab believes there is a financial arrangement between the police and the lawyers they recommend.\\n\\nMedhat was found guilty, and began his sentence. Exact figures are hard to come by, but by 2016, the New York Times reported that there were at least 250 incarcerated LGBTQ people. EIPR estimate there may be at least double the number of cases that they manage to fully document in their work. Because the legal interpretation of terms like “debauchery” or “public indecency” is so broad, sentences are often maximised by judges who “stack” similarly-worded offences. This means that LGBTQ people have been sentenced to up to 8 years for a single arrest.\\n\\nThe long-term effect is devastating. “I’ve seen perfectly healthy people go to prison for three years and how they looked coming out of it,” says Reem Shawky, a software specialist and photographer who does not experience a stable gender or sexuality, and who agreed to speak via email about LGBTQ issues. “Something happens that breaks them and they’re never the same again.”\\n\\nAccording to Abdel Rahman, the current crackdown is systemic and politicised, in relation to a more general attempt to create order and public legitimacy for the current Egyptian regime. In these circumstances, the LGBTQ community is an easy target.\\n\\n“In 2013 the regime was kind of unconsciously motivated by an attempt to regain order in the street and in the entire social fabric in the country,” states Abdel Rahman. “[That] means regaining every pillar of power relations in this society, be it in the family, be it in the street, or in the media.”\\n\\nAbdel Rahman notes that the controversial protest law of November 2013, which limited the ability of Egyptians to engage in public protest, came at the same moment as the first LGBT case that EIPR documented.\\n\\nEgyptian millennials are far more likely to be accepting of an LGBTQ individual than their parents were\\n\\nReem Shawky\\n\\n“I strongly doubt there was a coordination between these two movements,” he says. “But this kind of overlap tells you volumes about the mentality of the backlash … Now it is against the surge of all the [political] odds – the Islamists, ‘immoral’ elements in the streets, the radical left, the youth, the revolution … you name it.”\\n\\nBut beneath the political advantages and the profiteering within the police system, which are fuelling the current backlash, what potential might there be for public attitudes to change?\\n\\n“Egyptian millennials are far more likely to be accepting of an LGBTQ individual than their parents were,” says Reem Shawky. “Besides, with the rise of issues like global same-sex marriage legalisation … many seem okay with alternative sexualities (although they silently still judge). I don’t know if there’s hope for people changing [now], but there’s hope for coming generations.”\\n\\nAt EIPR, the fight is taken on several levels. Dalia Abdel Hameed says, “I’m not generally the optimistic kind of person, but surely, in my short activism life … I noticed a change. A huge one.” But she and her colleague Abdel Rahman understand that change will be slow. “Yes, [homosexuality] is considered immoral, but it’s not constant and it’s not the same as 10 years ago.”\\n\\nIn the face of slow progress, Abdel Rahman’s focus is more strategic than idealistic. EIPR’s drive now is less towards directly attempting to legitimate LGBT rights, and more towards leveraging a shift in public attitudes towards privacy.\\n\\nIt may seem that the counter-revolutionary backlash, in which the regime reasserted control over all parts of public life, is overwhelming. But one thing has changed. Abdel Rahman notices that Egyptians “detest the violation of people’s privacy ... And this is something that has significantly increased after [the revolution of] 25 January 2011. I mean the perception that there’s actually a space of private matters that shouldn’t be infringed upon by the government and by the media. This is very clear.”\\n\\nRegardless, Ragab, who is looking forward to moving in with his boyfriend, is impatient for change. “Everybody is fighting right now,” he says. “I am waiting for the day I can announce to the whole world that we are here. We are your friends, your brothers, your sisters, we are in your families. And I am sure that one day I will be doing this. I am not ashamed of my homosexuality, and I will never be.”\\n\\nNames have been changed to protect identities.\\n\\nJoin our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Updated over the years and offered in numerous limited-edition models, the Vantage will definitely be missed when a new generation comes around. But, the current iteration isn’t going away anytime soon and Aston Martin decided to spice things up by including it in its brand-new AMR program, which was launched at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.\\n\\nIf you’re familiar with the company’s intense racing program, you probably already know that AMR stands for Aston Martin Racing. The reason why the Brits are using the same letters for this project is because all non-racing AMR cars will be inspired by the successful GT3- and GT4-spec racers you’ve seen on the track in recent years. In short, Aston Martin just launched its very own high-performance department. And the good news is that it will make both road-legal and race-ready models.\\n\\nSpecifically, the AMR lineup will include two types of cars. There will be plain AMR versions closely related to their road-going counterparts and AMR Pro cars on the more extreme side of things. This Vantage falls in the latter category and the AMR Pro badge also means that its development was led by the Q by Aston Martin Advanced Operations, the department that helped create vehicles such as the Vantage GT12, Vantage GT8, and the Vulcan.\\n\\nAlthough just a concept here, the Vantage AMR Pro is set to become a full-fledged, fully customizable production model, joining the Rapide AMR concept that was also displayed at the Geneva Motor Show.\\n\\nContinue reading to learn more about the Aston Martin Vantage AMR concept.\\n\\nWhat makes the Aston Martin Vantage AMR concept special\\n\\nHeavily-based on Aston Martin Racing’s WEC-winning V8 Vantage GTE, the Vantage AMR Pro is as aggressive as its track-only sibling. This isn’t surprising, as the coupe was conceived as a track-only model. And it’s more than obvious given the large amount of race-spec features, starting with the menacing bumper and double splitter up front. The grille is also bespoke, featuring a honeycomb mesh and a black finish. And unlike the milder Rapide AMR, the Vantage AMR Pro is equipped with the same engine hood as the V8 Vantage GTE race car. Yup, it has the massive vent in the middle and thin intakes on each side of the center bulge. Sexy!\\n\\nHeavily-based on Aston Martin Racing\\'s WEC-winning V8 Vantage GTE, the Vantage AMR Pro is as aggressive as its track-only sibling.\\n\\nThe profile is equally aggressive thanks to its extremely wide side skirts and beefed-up wheel arches. The wheels are also race-spec, measuring 19 inches and featuring a center-lock design and Michelin Pilot Cup 2 tires. Around back, the AMR Pro sports the same rear wing as the GTE race cars, along with a new deck lid spoiler, and aggressive diffuser. Oh, and did I mention that it comes with a wide range of carbon-fiber parts? Yup, the front splitter, side skirts, mirror caps, rear wing and diffuser are all made from the lightweight material. The exterior is rounded off by the AMR-inspired Stirling Green body paint with yellowish lime green accents.\\n\\nInside, the center stack, console, and door panels are made from carbon-fiber for added lightness, while almost everything else is wrapped in Dark Knight Alcantara. Much like the exterior, the cabin is highlighted by lime green accents. The bright color can be seen on some of the buttons on the center stack, as well as on the seats in the form of contrast stitching and \"AMR\" lettering.\\n\\nInside, the center stack, console, and door panels are made from carbon-fiber for added lightness, while almost everything else is wrapped in Dark Knight Alcantara.\\n\\nThe Vantage AMR Pro also rides on a race-spec suspension system, while the standard 4.7-liter V-8 has been replaced by a development of Aston Martin Racing’s GT4 racing engine. Specifically, the V-8 cranks out 500 horsepower, a 70-horsepower increase over the standard unit, which makes the Vantage AMR Pro the most powerful Vantage ever created.\\n\\nProduction of this track-only car will be limited to only seven units. Needless to say, the Vantage AMR Pro will be one exclusive vehicle, but as a result of this, it will also be pretty expensive. Pricing is not yet available, but expect to pay significantly more than the most expensive road-legal Vantage out there.\\n\\nPress Release\\n\\nAston Martin has chosen the 2017 Geneva Motor Show to launch AMR - an exciting new brand that brings a new dimension of race inspired dynamism and performance.\\n\\nReflecting Aston Martin’s racing pedigree, AMR takes technology and inspiration from motorsport to amplify the sporting prowess present across the model range. With enhanced performance, sharper dynamics and more powerful design language, AMR takes Aston Martin’s road cars to new and exciting extremes.\\n\\nThe AMR brand follows in the wheeltracks of successive iconic Aston Martin road cars which boasted top-level racing pedigree. In the mid-1930s the success of Aston Martin’s Team Cars in the Ulster TT road race led the marque to build further examples of the lightweight two-seater for sale to the public. In 1951, Sir David Brown introduced uprated and highly desirable ‘Vantage’ specification models, and steered the marque to an historic outright win at Le Mans with the iconic DBR1 in 1959.\\n\\nSince the formation of Aston Martin Racing (AMR) in 2004 Aston Martin has enjoyed success in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), winning the 2016 FIA WEC GT Drivers Championship, while also securing three class victories at the 24 Hours of Le Mans over this period.

An AMR model will have an instantly recognisable design language. One that accentuates and amplifies, together with the latest GT race car technology for the road. They will be special and rare cars that are credible, thrilling to drive and hugely desirable to own.”\\n\\nThe Vantage AMR Pro is an extreme, track-only expression of performance and the ultimate iteration of the Vantage. Powered by a 507PS development of Aston Martin Racing’s GT4 race engine, the Vantage AMR Pro is the most powerful V8 Vantage ever. Race-spec adjustable suspension, competition engine and transmission mounts and new 19in x 9.5in front and 19in x 11.5in rear centre lock wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Cup 2 tyres, the Vantage AMR Pro promises inspirational handling precision and exceptional levels of grip and traction.\\n\\nThis race car performance is matched by authentic motorsport styling. Once again painted in Stirling Green with lime green accents, the Vantage AMR Pro not only takes its colour scheme from Aston Martin Racing’s V8 Vantage GTE racer, but uses the same bonnet and rear wing as the World Endurance Championship winner.\\n\\nTo compliment these authentic motorsport parts, Aston Martin’s design team has designed a new front bumper that incorporates a new bold full-height front grille, a new front valance and splitter, front fenders, sill appliques and a revised rear diffuser.\\n\\nThe racing theme continues inside, with extensive use of carbon fibre, lavish Dark Knight Alcantara upholstery with lime green accents and a custom roll cage designed by Q by Aston Martin. The result is a Vantage that looks as spectacular as it drives.\\n\\nAston Martin’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Andy Palmer, was quick to confirm that both the Rapide AMR and Vantage AMR Pro concepts are set for production: “As passionate enthusiasts of Aston Martin’s competition pedigree, AMR is something we have wanted to bring to fruition for some time. Cars such as the Vantage GT8 and Vantage GT12 confirmed that our customers love raw, race-bred models, but we also knew there was an opportunity to create cars that offer a sharper performance focus but stop short of those truly hardcore, special series models. With the AMR brand we have the perfect platform to deliver both.\\n\\nAs proof of that intent I’m incredibly excited to announce that we will be putting both the Vantage AMR Pro and Rapide AMR into production: the Vantage in an extremely limited series of no more than 7 cars; the Rapide as a run of only 210 cars.

Some of these factors may include inappropriate prescription practices, inadequate patient education, limited diagnostic facilities, unauthorized sale of antimicrobials, lack of appropriate functioning drug regulatory mechanisms, and non-human use of antimicrobials such as in animal production. Considering that these factors in developing countries may vary from those in developed countries, intervention efforts in developing countries need to address the context and focus on the root causes specific to this part of the world. Here, we describe these health-seeking behaviors that lead to the threat of AMR and healthcare practices that drive the development of AMR in developing countries and we discuss alternatives for disease prevention as well as other treatment options worth exploring.\\n\\nKeywords\\n\\nAntimicrobial therapy Developing countries Microorganisms Resistance\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is growing at an alarming rate and the situation is perhaps aggravated in developing countries due to gross abuse in the use of antimicrobials [1]. It is well known that any use of antimicrobials however appropriate and justified, contributes to the development of resistance, but widespread unnecessary and excessive use makes the situation worse [2]. Misuse of antimicrobials is facilitated in developing countries by their availability over the counter, without prescription and through unregulated supply chains [1, 3]. Non-compliance in the use of antimicrobials has many repercussions upon resistance and poverty is a major root factor of antimicrobial misuse in developing countries [4]. On the other hand, even among the rich, some patients miss doses either by mistake or deliberate, especially in cases where signs and symptoms begin to subside after an initial favorable therapeutic response [5]. In other situations, such as in the event of an acute side effect, patients abandon their treatment, only to return to the hospital with a recurring infection by a more virulent and resistant strain of the microbe [6]. These actions result in the exposure of surviving pathogens to sub-therapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials thus increasing the chances of acquiring resistance. Self-medication is a common practice in developing countries where patients often get antimicrobials without prescription and through unregulated supply chains [7]. To make the situation even worst, some patients seek their first-line of treatment from traditional healers who provide them with herbal combinations for the treatment of infections. These substances of unknown composition and potency may enhance pathogen fitness and contribute to the development of resistance. Antimicrobial resistance often occur through the inhibition of specific antimicrobial pathways such as cell wall synthesis, nucleic acid synthesis, ribosome function, protein synthesis, folate metabolism, and cell membrane function [8–10].\\n\\nCauses of antimicrobial resistance\\n\\nTo better appreciate the causes of AMR, we need to understand the various sequential steps involved for a drug to get to a patient and the eventual use, which include; production, distribution, prescription, dispensing, and finally consumption of the drug by the patient or use in animal production [11]. Consequently, any imprudent practice along this flow may result in the emergence of resistance.\\n\\nDrug dispensers and drug quality\\n\\nThe lack of appropriate regulations in the sales of antimicrobials is also a driving factor in the access and misuse of antimicrobials. In most developing countries, antimicrobials can be purchased without medical prescription [12] and are usually dispensed on the streets by untrained persons. These drug vendors will sell medications just to make a sale and accommodate patients’ ability to pay [13]. Even pharmacies operating without a license, appear to be more accessible to the public as they have shorter waiting time, do not charge consultation fees and above all are willing to negotiate treatment options to adjust to the financial ability of the patients [14]. Retail pharmacies in developing countries especially in Africa have emerged as the primary level of outpatient care rendering unauthorized services from consultation, diagnosis, prescription and dispensing of medication [14, 15].\\n\\nIt has also been shown that many antimicrobials dispensed in Africa are of questionable pharmacological quality [16, 17]. Adverse climatic conditions such as high ambient temperatures and humidity may affect the overall quality of the antimicrobials during storage [18, 19]. Poor storage also increases the risk of degradation of the drug. Degraded medicines contain less than stated dose, implying that patients consume less than optimal dose of the drug. There is also a problem of outright counterfeit, in which the drug may contain little or no active substance of the antimicrobial or the wrong substance [20]. The influx of counterfeit and sub-standard antimicrobials into the pharmaceutical markets in some regions is a major problem as these preparations of reduced potency also result in pathogens being exposed to sub-therapeutic concentrations of the drug [21]. A study from Cameroon revealed that, out of 284 antimalarial obtained from 132 vendors, 32% of chloroquine, 10% quinine, and 13% sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine were likely to be fake [16]. In addition, some of the quinine contained chloroquine while some chloroquine contained no active ingredient or an amount lower than the expected concentration.\\n\\nHealth professionals\\n\\nHealth care providers play an essential role in the treatment and prevention of diseases, but may jeopardize this if their practices are not evidence-based (Table 1). For example, the prescription practices of antimicrobials vary among physicians in most countries. In some cases, the antimicrobial prescriptions are inappropriate (i.e., wrong drug, wrong doses, or antimicrobial not necessary at all) [22]. Due to the high patient-doctor ratio in most developing countries, doctors are overwhelmed and there is often inadequate time for meaningful education and communication with the patient on drug adherence guidelines and consequences of poor or non-adherence to these guidelines. Treatment sometimes consists of administering broad-spectrum antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and indication for antimicrobial treatment. In a Lebanese study, it was shown that in 52% of cases, the prescription dose was inappropriate while 63.7% of physicians prescribed antibiotics with wrong duration of treatment [23].\\n\\nFactors\\n\\nContribution\\n\\nExample\\n\\nPoor drug quality\\n\\nSales of counterfeit, adulterated and poor quality antibiotics\\n\\nThese poor quality antibiotics can produce sub-inhibitory concentration in vivo, which increases the selection of resistant strains\\n\\nRegulators\\n\\nWhile most developed countries have developed AMR action plans, this is still lacking in many developing countries especially in Africa\\n\\nMost countries lack the resources to enforce policies regarding the manufacture and distribution of sub-standard drugs\\n\\nPrescribers\\n\\nExcessive clinical use and misuse is partially responsible for increase rate of resistance\\n\\nVariation in prescription practice among health care provider. Sometimes there is prescription of a wrong drug, wrong doses, or antimicrobial not necessary at all\\n\\nDispensers\\n\\nDrug vendors usually have little or no knowledge of the required dosage regimen, indication, or contraindications\\n\\nMedications are usually purchased in small aliquots from roadside stall and storage and distribution is usually done under inadequate conditions\\n\\nUsers (patients)\\n\\nHigh rate of self- medication and lack of treatment compliance\\n\\nPatients fail to adhere to dosage regimens and discontinue treatment when symptoms subside before pathogen is eliminated\\n\\nAnimal industry\\n\\nThe use of antimicrobial drugs in agriculture or industrial settings, exerts a selection pressure which can favor the survival of resistant strains (or genes) over susceptible ones, leading to a relative increase in resistant bacteria within microbial communities\\n\\nResistant bacteria in animals can be transferred to humans through the consumption of food or through direct contact with food-producing animals or through environmental spread\\n\\nDue to lack of effective and reliable surveillance systems and poor dissemination of research information, health professionals in developing countries sometimes lack up to date information on the AMR pattern within their populations. In tertiary hospitals with advanced capacities, physicians rely mostly on the resistance or susceptibility pattern of the pathogen isolated from a patient. Health personnel in rural settings without the capacity to do AMR testing have difficulty to decide on the choice of antimicrobial in the absence of an antimicrobial sensitivity test. As a result, health professionals use more and more broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat infections caused by several bacteria species or those for which establishing the etiology is difficult or takes a long time. This practice contributes to the development of resistance [24] as the drug applies selective pressure, not only upon the etiological agent of the disease episode but also upon a large fraction of the patient’s microbiota [25]. Some health professionals issue prescriptions that are not evidence-based and rely on a syndromic approach to both infections in the community as well as hospitalized patients. That is treatment is based on easily recognized signs and symptoms (syndromes) as well as to microorganism most commonly responsible for each of these syndromes. This practice is on the rise due to the lack of legal consequences of wrongful prescription of antibiotics. Our preliminary findings in Cameroon revealed that a significant number of physicians are likely to prescribe antibiotics to treat diarrhea caused by rotavirus, due to the lack of capacity to establish the diagnosis (Unpublished). Due to fear of bad treatment outcomes of critical diseases, some physicians may resort to blind prescription of multiple and broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Meanwhile, because of financial incentives from drug suppliers, some physicians are prone to prescribing multiple antibiotics for the same condition [26].\\n\\nPatients\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, compliance is a major contributor to the development of AMR [27]. Patients miss doses, either by mistake or deliberate. Because patients are aware of the adverse impact of drinking alcohol while on antibiotics, some patients may skip doses when invited for a party in favor for the consumption of alcohol (unpublished data). These practices result in exposure of surviving microbes to sub-therapeutic concentrations of the drug and, consequently increases the chances of developing resistance [25]. Because of poverty, many sick individuals in developing countries of Africa often seek their first-line of treatment from traditional healers who provide them with herbal mixtures of unknown efficacy for the treatment of infections. Some combine antibiotics with their herbal mixtures simultaneously while others take antimicrobials and supplement them with herbal mixtures purportedly to improve efficacy [12]. These compounds of unknown potency may enhance pathogen fitness.\\n\\nNon-human use of antimicrobials\\n\\nAntimicrobials are used to prevent (prophylaxis in high risk animals) and treat diseases in animals, as well as used as growth promoters in animal breeding [28, 29]. Additionally, they are used as additives in plant agriculture (fruits, vegetables, and orchid, etc.), especially in the spraying of fruit trees for disease prophylaxis and the application of antibiotic-containing manure on farmland and in industrial processes [30]. The use of antimicrobial agents in animals and more importantly food-producing animals has important consequences for both human and animal health as it can lead to the development of resistant bacteria (Table 1). These resistant bacteria (with resistance genes) in animals can be transferred to humans through the consumption of food or through direct contact with food-producing animals or through environmental spread (e.g. human sewage and runoff water from agricultural sites). The use of antimicrobial drugs in health care, agriculture or industrial settings, exerts a selection pressure which can favor the survival of resistant strains (or genes) over susceptible ones, leading to a relative increase in resistant bacteria within microbial communities [31]. It is now known that increased AMR in bacteria affecting humans and animals is primarily influenced by an increase in the use of antimicrobials for a variety of purposes, including therapeutic and non-therapeutic purposes in animal production [32]. A strong association between agricultural use of antimicrobials and the development of resistance has been suggested [33], and it has been shown that the bulk of antimicrobials used worldwide are not consumed by humans but rather are given to animals for the purposes of food production [34].\\n\\nMultidrug resistant bacteria have been detected in both meat and fresh produce [35] and in humans in contact with livestock in many African countries [36–38]. A study in Kenya revealed a high level of antimicrobial drug residues in meat meant for consumption [34]. These findings further demonstrate that food animals are a major reservoir of drug resistant bacteria and present a major risk for dissemination and transmission of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in Africa as well as many developing countries. A large proportion of the population in developing countries live in close proximity with animals, thus increasing the chances of transmission of resistant microorganisms from animals to humans through animal handling [39, 40]. In a recent study in rural Bangladesh animal healthcare providers responded they more often sought animal health care from pharmacies and village doctors, citing the latter two as less costly and more successful based on past performance [41]. In the absence of an effective animal healthcare system, villagers depend on informal healthcare providers for treatment of their animals. This may lead to suboptimal use of antimicrobials in such settings with unhygienic animal husbandry practices. In terms of aquaculture, heavy use of prophylactic antibiotics in aquaculture has been reported in developing countries and is a growing problem for human and animal health and for the environment [42].\\n\\nOverall, limiting the routine use of in-feed antibiotics will improve human and animal health, by reducing the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, judicious use of antibiotics in healthcare and agricultural settings is essential to slow the emergence of resistance and extend the useful lifetime of effective antibiotics that are in existence today.\\n\\nIn other to minimize the risk of AMR due to non-human use of antimicrobials especially in animal production, information resources in developing countries need to be strengthened to support health professionals, patients, animal keepers and the public, so that the society can have a better understanding of the value and importance of antimicrobials, especially antibiotics. Taken together, the excessive use of antimicrobials in animals and agriculture and the associated public health consequences justifies the importance of limiting the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in both agriculture and the veterinary sector.\\n\\nInadequate surveillance and limited laboratory antimicrobial susceptibility testing\\n\\nThe availability of routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing to provide information on resistance trends, including emerging resistance is very essential for routine clinical practice and for the development of effective policies against AMR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not often performed in most rural laboratories due to lack of capacity. In the absence of patient-specific antimicrobial susceptibility testing, community-based antimicrobial surveillance data may be very useful to health care professionals in particular communities or regions to treat infections with specific susceptible antimicrobials. Such surveillance needs to be conducted regularly and continuously because resistance rates can vary in one region of a country over time.\\n\\nAntimicrobial resistance control strategies\\n\\nThe problem of AMR is aggravated by the fact that most world pharmaceutical companies consider research for new antimicrobials as being of “low profit” and some speculate that resistance will eventually develop for new antimicrobials anyway. Consequently, they prefer to invest in the development of drugs for chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension) as well as those used to improve lifestyle (e.g., Cialis, Viagra, etc.) [43]. Therefore, the long-term solution should be focused on methods to prevent the emergence of resistance or the spread of resistant organisms from one person to another.\\n\\nHygiene and sanitation\\n\\nApart from the irrational use of antimicrobials, unique environmental conditions such as crowding and poor sanitation also contribute in the circulation and spread of resistant microorganisms. Transmission of resistant pathogens is facilitated by person-person contact, through contaminated water, food or by vectors. Improving basic hygiene and sanitation will reduce the spread of resistant organisms (Table 2) [44]. Improving infection prevention and control in hospitals will reduce the nosocomial spread of bacteria with acquired resistance such as Staphylococcus aureus amongst others.\\n\\nControl strategies\\n\\nContribution\\n\\nHygiene and sanitation\\n\\nImproving basic hygiene and sanitation will reduce the spread of resistant organisms\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nVaccination may reduce severity of disease, provide protection against shedding of pathogens and even raise the threshold load of pathogens required for infection\\n\\nAlternative therapies\\n\\nThe reluctance of pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and development of novel antimicrobial agents necessitate the exploration of alternative therapies such as bacteriophage, probiotics and Quorum Sensing inhibitors\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nHealth care providers, dispensers and patients need to be educated on how the use and misuse of antimicrobial may contribute to the development of resistance\\n\\nInfection prevention & control\\n\\nProper hospital infection control may prevent the spread of nosocomial pathogens and resistant microbes that may have easily been disseminated to the community if these measure were not in place\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nWhile antimicrobials are used for treatment, vaccines are a primary mode of prevention of infectious diseases. Prior vaccination may reduce severity of disease, provide protection against shedding of pathogens and even raise the threshold load of pathogens required for infection [45–47]. Also, indirect population protection of some vaccines as a result of herd immunity in unvaccinated individuals represents additional advantage of vaccination. In most regions of the world, a number of diseases such as smallpox, measles, mumps rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis A, pertussis, and polio have been prevented by vaccination [48].\\n\\nHowever, even with the most effective vaccine, the need of antimicrobials or alternative treatment options will still in some cases be solicited. For example, in the case of genetic drift, escape mutants and serotype or strain replacement diseases, vaccination may fail to confer full protection from disease. For bacterial infections, the introduction of conjugate vaccines for example Streptococcus pneumoniae, has reduced the outbreak of respiratory infections in children in developing countries [49].\\n\\nAlternative therapies\\n\\nThe increase in microbial resistance to traditional antimicrobials and the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and development of novel antimicrobial agents necessitate the exploration of alternative therapies. Future focus of medical therapeutics and research is to look beyond antibiotics [43], and search for alternatives which can regulate the microbial virulence as well as growth inhibition. There are currently a couple of other alternatives approaches at different levels of research and development.\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe use of bacteriophage is emerging as an alternative treatment option for bacteria infections [50]. Many authors have suggested that bacteriophage therapy is a necessary alternative to conventional antibiotics [51, 52]. Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses with the capacity to invade bacterial cells and induce lysis of the bacteria (lytic cycle). In the present era of multidrug resistant bacteria and reluctance in the development of new antibiotics by pharmaceutical companies, the need to aggressively explore the possibility of phage therapy is unprecedented.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nQuorum Sensing inhibitors represents an important antimicrobial target that may prevent, suppress, and/or treat infectious diseases. The mechanistic details (including auto-inducers) of Quorum Sensing are different between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria utilize N-acyl l-homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are homoserine lactone (HSL) rings with an additional fatty acid side chain while Gram positive bacteria uses oligopeptides [53–55]. While antibiotics kill or slow down the growth of bacteria, quorum sensing inhibitors or quorum quenchers simply attenuate bacterial virulence. A large body of work on Quorum Sensing has been carried out in deadly pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio. harveyi, Escherichia coli and Vibrio. cholerae etc. A number of these studies have succeeded in exploiting the bacterial Quorum Sensing system as potential target for treatment of bacterial infections. The inhibition of Quorum Sensing system is believed to be advantageous over conventional antibiotics, because only the communication mechanism between the bacteria is disrupted without killing the individual cells. Hence, this strategy should generate a lower selective pressure and reduce the rate at which AMR develops during the treatment [55].\\n\\n3.\\n\\nProbiotics, otherwise referred to as fecal transplant therapy (FTT) is a treatment option that has been employed for decades, albeit with mixed results [56–58]. FTT is the act of using fecal material from pathogen-free healthy donors to repopulate the microbiota of a recipient. Probiotics are considered to be able to destroy pathogenic microorganisms by producing antimicrobial compounds such as bacteriocins and organic acids, improve gastrointestinal microbial environment by adherence to intestinal mucosa thereby preventing attachment of pathogens and competing with pathogens for nutrients, stimulate the intestinal immune responses and improve the digestion and absorption of nutrients. The commonly used probiotics include Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Pseudomonas, yeast, Aspergillus, and Trichoderma, etc.\\n\\nThis treatment option is an old practice, used many years ago, especially in China and had been successfully used to treat Clostridium difficile infections as well as other enteric diseases [56, 59, 60].\\n\\nTaken together, the application of these alternate therapies is not limited to developing countries and most are still under development or at different stages of clinical trial and their routine availability will require governmental approval and subvention in developing countries.\\n\\nThe role of stakeholders in the control of antimicrobial resistance\\n\\nThe control of AMR cannot be the sole responsibility of medical professionals and scientists. Although continuing education is essential to enable health care providers learn the need in rational prescription practices and the importance of evidence-based prescription [61], the general population and other stakeholders have a central role to play [62]. The government of every country should consider AMR as a public health priority issue. Policies and regulations should be put in place to enforce the prudent access and use of antimicrobials. The population needs to be educated on the threat of AMR and therefore media professionals need to get adequate training on how to convey medical and scientific information in lay language through multiple channels to inform the populations on practices that promote the emergence of AMR organisms [62]. The benefits of an education program for journalists has been successful for the fight against HIV/AIDS in many developing countries and a similar approach for AMR will likely result to an added benefit [63, 64]. A number of initiatives have been taken so far by regulatory agencies and governments in the combat of antimicrobial resistance but most of these initiatives have been done only in developed countries [65–68] and are lacking in resource limited nations [69, 70].\\n\\nA few African countries have been identified as being involved in the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP), established in 2009 to create a platform for developing actionable policy proposals on antibiotic resistance in low-income and middle-income countries. Unfortunately, to date national GARP working groups are established only in a few African countries [70]. There is therefore need to generate solutions such as to build a strong African laboratory infrastructure to help combat AMR which is a global health threat [71]. A multi-disciplinary approach involving a wide range of partners is therefore needed to limit the risk of AMR and minimize its impact on human and animal health especially in developing countries.\\n\\nThe role of government regulatory agencies\\n\\nWith the new and emergent issue regarding the development of AMR, government agencies globally have engaged in new action plans in order to combat the AMR issue [72]. However, actions toward this has been severely lacking in developing countries especially those in Africa where high quality regulatory agencies are lacking. In May 2015, the WHO endorsed a global action plan to tackle AMR [73]. In September 2014, the US government released a ‘National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria’ that included an executive order signed by the US president [68]. The action plan provided several goals and a roadmap to guide the Nation in rising to this challenge. In 2013, the United Kingdom released the ‘UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy (2013 to 2018)’ that sets out actions to address the key challenges to AMR [67]. Similarly, in 2015, the government of Canada also released the Federal Action Plan on antimicrobial resistance and use in Canada (Building on the federal framework for action) [66]. While many developed countries have developed such AMR action plans either nationally or at the regional level such as the European Union and Asia-Pacific region, this is still lacking in many developing countries especially in Africa [69]. A few African countries have been identified as being involved in the Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership (GARP), established in 2009 to create a platform for developing actionable policy proposals on antibiotic resistance in low-income and middle-income countries. However, national GARP working groups are established only in India, Kenya, South Africa, Vietnam, Mozambique, Nepal, Tanzania and Uganda. Moreover, a close look at the national action plans showed that only one African country (Ethiopia), was identified by the WHO as having a national AMR action plan [74] .\\n\\nWhat most developing countries especially those in Africa lack is not the legislation prohibiting the manufacture and distribution of sub-standard drugs but resources to enforce these policies and to impose penalties to defaulters. There is also lack of resources to identify counterfeit drugs or verify the quality of locally manufactured or imported drugs [75]. In addition, governments need to address the sale of antimicrobials without prescription and illegalize the dispensing of drugs by unauthorized and unqualified persons. There is also need for the population to be sensitized on the public health risks of AMR. A recent WHO survey revealed that while much activity is underway and many governments are committed to addressing the AMR problem, there are major gaps in actions needed across all 6 WHO regions to prevent the misuse of antibiotics and reduce spread of AMR [69]. Despite these challenges some progress is currently being made in setting up drug regulatory agencies in Africa. The effort is supported by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) of the African Union and the WHO. Through the creation of the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization (AMRH), it is envisioned that safe, good quality, efficacious and reasonably priced medicines will be available in Africa [76]. Recently, the African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) has engaged in activities to share research, debate, and generate solutions to build a strong African laboratory infrastructure to help combat common global health threats, like AMR as well as HIV/AIDS, and other medical conditions [71]. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a wide range of partners is therefore needed to limit the risk of AMR and minimize its impact on human and animal health especially in developing countries.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThe irrational use of antimicrobials is certainly a complex and multifactorial problem in developing countries, and a proper understanding of the problem is necessary for effective control policies. Without effective antimicrobials, diverse medical procedures such as surgery, the care of premature infants, cancer chemotherapy, care of the critically ill, invasive diagnostic and treatment procedures, and transplantation medicine will be severely hampered with a corresponding increase in morbidity and mortality from secondary microbial infections. The challenge of global antimicrobial resistance is comparable to climate change and global warming. Therefore, as we seek to protect the climate for the future generation, it is our responsibility not to pass over to the next generation, microbial population that is resistant to antimicrobial agents that they are supposed to treat as the consequence is likely to be very dangerous.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nAIDS:\\n\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome\\n\\nAMR:\\n\\nAntimicrobial resistance\\n\\nFTT:\\n\\nFecal transplant therapy\\n\\nHIV:\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus\\n\\nGARP:\\n\\nGlobal antibiotic resistance partnership\\n\\nDeclarations\\n\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nNot applicable.\\n\\nFunding\\n\\nNot applicable.\\n\\nAvailability of data and materials\\n\\n“Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\\n\\nAuthors’ contributions\\n\\nJAA did the initial literature search, wrote the first draft as well as coordinated the writing of the entire manuscript; MN designed the outline, performed literature search and contributed in writing; and ANA reviewed the first draft, provided relevant editing as well as writing and performed reference formatting.

       " 'Sections\\n\\nMay 10, 2017 Digital Economy affective computing, Digital Resource Management\\n\\nResearch Brief\\n\\nHeroes in the Race to Save Antibiotics\\n\\nMisuse and abuse of antibiotics have spawned antibiotic-resistant superbugs that turn minor cuts into killers. Researchers are using digital to battle what could be the deadliest and most costly human-made catastrophe in modern times.\\n\\nDr. David Delaney, Joseph Miles, Walt Ellenberger, Saravana Chandran, and Stephanie Overby\\n\\nLast August, a woman arrived at a Reno, Nevada, hospital and told the attending doctors that she had recently returned from an extended trip to India, where she had broken her right thighbone two years ago. The woman, who was in her 70s, had subsequently developed an infection in her thigh and hip for which she was hospitalized in India several times. The Reno doctors recognized that the infection was serious—and the visit to India, where antibiotic-resistant bacteria runs rampant, raised red flags.\\n\\nWhen none of the 14 antibiotics the physicians used to treat the woman worked, they sent a sample of the bacterium to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for testing. The CDC confirmed the doctors’ worst fears: the woman had a class of microbe called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Carbapenems are a powerful class of antibiotics used as last-resort treatment for multidrug-resistant infections. The CDC further found that, in this patient’s case, the pathogen was impervious to all 26 antibiotics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\\n\\nIn other words, there was no cure.\\n\\nThis is just the latest alarming development signaling the end of the road for antibiotics as we know them. In September, the woman died from septic shock, in which an infection takes over and shuts down the body’s systems, according to the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\\n\\nOther antibiotic options, had they been available, might have saved the Nevada woman. But the solution to the larger problem won’t be a new drug. It will have to be an entirely new approach to the diagnosis of infectious disease, to the use of antibiotics, and to the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)—all enabled by new technology.\\n\\nBut that new technology is not being implemented fast enough to prevent what former CDC director Tom Frieden has nicknamed nightmare bacteria. And the nightmare is becoming scarier by the year. A 2014 British study calculated that 700,000 people die globally each year because of AMR. By 2050, the global cost of antibiotic resistance could grow to 10 million deaths and US$100 trillion a year, according to a 2014 estimate. And the rate of AMR is growing exponentially, thanks to the speed with which humans serving as hosts for these nasty bugs can move among healthcare facilities—or countries. In the United States, for example, CRE had been seen only in North Carolina in 2000; today it’s nationwide.\\n\\nAbuse and overuse of antibiotics in healthcare and livestock production have enabled bacteria to both mutate and acquire resistant genes from other organisms, resulting in truly pan-drug resistant organisms. As ever-more powerful superbugs continue to proliferate, we are potentially facing the deadliest and most costly human-made catastrophe in modern times.\\n\\n“Without urgent, coordinated action by many stakeholders, the world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill,” said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security for the World Health Organization (WHO).\\n\\nEven if new antibiotics could solve the problem, there are obstacles to their development. For one thing, antibiotics have complex molecular structures, which slows the discovery process. Further, they aren’t terribly lucrative for pharmaceutical manufacturers: public health concerns call for new antimicrobials to be financially accessible to patients and used conservatively precisely because of the AMR issue, which reduces the financial incentives to create new compounds. The last entirely new class of antibiotic was introduced 30 year ago. Finally, bacteria will develop resistance to new antibiotics as well if we don’t adopt new approaches to using them.\\n\\nTechnology can play the lead role in heading off this disaster. Vast amounts of data from multiple sources are required for better decision making at all points in the process, from tracking or predicting antibiotic-resistant disease outbreaks to speeding the potential discovery of new antibiotic compounds. However, microbes will quickly adapt and resist new medications, too, if we don’t also employ systems that help doctors diagnose and treat infection in a more targeted and judicious way.\\n\\nIndeed, digital tools can help in all four actions that the CDC recommends for combating AMR: preventing infections and their spread, tracking resistance patterns, improving antibiotic use, and developing new diagnostics and treatment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, individuals who understand both the complexities of AMR and the value of technologies like machine learning, human-computer interaction (HCI), and mobile applications are working to develop and advocate for solutions that could save millions of lives.\\n\\nKeeping an Eye Out for Outbreaks\\n\\nLike others who are leading the fight against AMR, Dr. Steven Solomon has no illusions about the difficulty of the challenge. “It is the single most complex problem in all of medicine and public health—far outpacing the complexity and the difficulty of any other problem that we face,” says Solomon, who is a global health consultant and former director of the CDC’s Office of Antimicrobial Resistance.\\n\\nSolomon wants to take the battle against AMR beyond the laboratory. In his view, surveillance—tracking and analyzing various data on AMR—is critical, particularly given how quickly and widely it spreads. But surveillance efforts are currently fraught with shortcomings. The available data is fragmented and often not comparable. Hospitals fail to collect the representative samples necessary for surveillance analytics, collecting data only on those patients who experience resistance and not on those who get better. Laboratories use a wide variety of testing methods, and reporting is not always consistent or complete.\\n\\nSurveillance can serve as an early warning system. But weaknesses in these systems have caused public health officials to consistently underestimate the impact of AMR in loss of lives and financial costs. That’s why improving surveillance must be a top priority, says Solomon, who previously served as chair of the U.S. Federal Interagency Task Force on AMR and has been tracking the advance of AMR since he joined the U.S. Public Health Service in 1981.\\n\\nA Collaborative Diagnosis\\n\\nIneffective surveillance has also contributed to huge growth in the use of antibiotics when they aren’t warranted. Strong patient demand and financial incentives for prescribing physicians are blamed for antibiotics abuse in China. India has become the largest consumer of antibiotics on the planet, in part because they are prescribed or sold for diarrheal diseases and upper respiratory infections for which they have limited value. And many countries allow individuals to purchase antibiotics over the counter, exacerbating misuse and overuse.\\n\\nIn the United States, antibiotics are improperly prescribed 50% of the time, according to CDC estimates. One study of adult patients visiting U.S. doctors to treat respiratory problems found that more than two-thirds of antibiotics were prescribed for conditions that were not infections at all or for infections caused by viruses—for which an antibiotic would do nothing. That’s 27 million courses of antibiotics wasted a year—just for respiratory problems—in the United States alone.\\n\\nAnd even in countries where there are national guidelines for prescribing antibiotics, those guidelines aren’t always followed. A study published in medical journal Family Practice showed that Swedish doctors, both those trained in Sweden and those trained abroad, inconsistently followed rules for prescribing antibiotics.\\n\\nSolomon strongly believes that, worldwide, doctors need to expand their use of technology in their offices or at the bedside to guide them through a more rational approach to antibiotic use. Doctors have traditionally been reluctant to adopt digital technologies, but Solomon thinks that the AMR crisis could change that. New digital tools could help doctors and hospitals integrate guidelines for optimal antibiotic prescribing into their everyday treatment routines.\\n\\n“Human-computer interactions are critical, as the amount of information available on antibiotic resistance far exceeds the ability of humans to process it,” says Solomon. “It offers the possibility of greatly enhancing the utility of computer-assisted physician order entry (CPOE), combined with clinical decision support.” Healthcare facilities could embed relevant information and protocols at the point of care, guiding the physician through diagnosis and prescription and, as a byproduct, facilitating the collection and reporting of antibiotic use.\\n\\nCincinnati Children’s Hospital’s antibiotic stewardship division has deployed a software program that gathers information from electronic medical records, order entries, computerized laboratory and pathology reports, and more. The system measures baseline antimicrobial use, dosing, duration, costs, and use patterns. It also analyzes bacteria and trends in their susceptibilities and helps with clinical decision making and prescription choices. The goal, says Dr. David Haslam, who heads the program, is to decrease the use of “big gun” super antibiotics in favor of more targeted treatment.\\n\\nWhile this approach is not yet widespread, there is consensus that incorporating such clinical-decision support into electronic health records will help improve quality of care, contain costs, and reduce overtreatment in healthcare overall—not just in AMR. A 2013 randomized clinical trial finds that doctors who used decision-support tools were significantly less likely to order antibiotics than those in the control group and prescribed 50% fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics.\\n\\nPutting mobile devices into doctors’ hands could also help them accept decision support, believes Solomon. Last summer, Scotland’s National Health Service developed an antimicrobial companion app to give practitioners nationwide mobile access to clinical guidance, as well as an audit tool to support boards in gathering data for local and national use.\\n\\n“The immediacy and the consistency of the input to physicians at the time of ordering antibiotics may significantly help address the problem of overprescribing in ways that less-immediate interventions have failed to do,” Solomon says. In addition, handheld devices with so-called lab-on-a-chip technology could be used to test clinical specimens at the bedside and transmit the data across cellular or satellite networks in areas where infrastructure is more limited.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can also become invaluable technology collaborators to help doctors more precisely diagnose and treat infection. In such a system, “the physician and the AI program are really ‘co-prescribing,’” says Solomon. “The AI can handle so much more information than the physician and make recommendations that can incorporate more input on the type of infection, the patient’s physiologic status and history, and resistance patterns of recent isolates in that ward, in that hospital, and in the community.”\\n\\nSpeed Is Everything\\n\\nGrowing bacteria in a dish has never appealed to Dr. James Davis, a computational biologist with joint appointments at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago Computation Institute. The first of a growing breed of computational biologists, Davis chose a PhD advisor in 2004 who was steeped in bioinformatics technology “because you could see that things were starting to change,” he says. He was one of the first in his microbiology department to submit a completely “dry” dissertation—that is, one that was all digital with nothing grown in a lab.\\n\\nUpon graduation, Davis wanted to see if it was possible to predict whether an organism would be susceptible or resistant to a given antibiotic, leading him to explore the potential of machine learning to predict AMR.\\n\\nAs the availability of cheap computing power has gone up and the cost of genome sequencing has gone down, it has become possible to sequence a pathogen sample in order to detect its AMR resistance mechanisms. This could allow doctors to identify the nature of an infection in minutes instead of hours or days, says Davis.\\n\\nDavis is part of a team creating a giant database of bacterial genomes with AMR metadata for the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC), funded by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to collect data on priority pathogens, such as tuberculosis and gonorrhea.\\n\\nBecause the current inability to identify microbes quickly is one of the biggest roadblocks to making an accurate diagnosis, the team’s work is critically important. The standard method for identifying drug resistance is to take a sample from a wound, blood, or urine and expose the resident bacteria to various antibiotics. If the bacterial colony continues to divide and thrive despite the presence of a normally effective drug, it indicates resistance. The process typically takes between 16 and 20 hours, itself an inordinate amount of time in matters of life and death. For certain strains of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis, though, such testing can take a week. While physicians are waiting for test results, they often prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics or make a best guess about what drug will work based on their knowledge of what’s happening in their hospital, “and in the meantime, you either get better,” says Davis, “or you don’t.”\\n\\nAt PATRIC, researchers are using machine-learning classifiers to identify regions of the genome involved in antibiotic resistance that could form the foundation for a “laboratory free” process for predicting resistance. Being able to identify the genetic mechanisms of AMR and predict the behavior of bacterial pathogens without petri dishes could inform clinical decision making and improve reaction time. Thus far, the researchers have developed machine-learning classifiers for identifying antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii (a big player in hospital-acquired infection), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (a.k.a. MRSA, a worldwide problem), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (a leading cause of bacterial meningitis), with accuracies ranging from 88% to 99%.\\n\\nHouston Methodist Hospital, which uses the PATRIC database, is researching multidrug-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA. Not only does resistance increase the cost of care, but people with MRSA are 64% more likely to die than people with a nonresistant form of the infection, according to WHO. Houston Methodist is investigating the molecular genetic causes of drug resistance in MRSA in order to identify new treatment approaches and help develop novel antimicrobial agents.\\n\\nThe Hunt for a New Class of Antibiotics\\n\\nThere are antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and then there’s Clostridium difficile—a.k.a. C. difficile—a bacterium that attacks the intestines even in young and healthy patients in hospitals after the use of antibiotics.\\n\\nIt is because of C. difficile that Dr. L. Clifford McDonald jumped into the AMR fight. The epidemiologist was finishing his work analyzing the spread of SARS in Toronto hospitals in 2004 when he turned his attention to C. difficile, convinced that the bacteria would become more common and more deadly. He was right, and today he’s at the forefront of treating the infection and preventing the spread of AMR as senior advisor for science and integrity in the CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. “[AMR] is an area that we’re funding heavily…insofar as the CDC budget can fund anything heavily,” says McDonald, whose group has awarded $14 million in contracts for innovative anti-AMR approaches.\\n\\nDeveloping new antibiotics is a major part of the AMR battle. The majority of new antibiotics developed in recent years have been variations of existing drug classes. It’s been three decades since the last new class of antibiotics was introduced. Less than 5% of venture capital in pharmaceutical R&D is focused on antimicrobial development. A 2008 study found that less than 10% of the 167 antibiotics in development at the time had a new “mechanism of action” to deal with multidrug resistance. “The low-hanging fruit [of antibiotic development] has been picked,” noted a WHO report.\\n\\nResearchers will have to dig much deeper to develop novel medicines. Machine learning could help drug developers sort through much larger data sets and go about the capital-intensive drug development process in a more prescriptive fashion, synthesizing those molecules most likely to have an impact.\\n\\nMcDonald believes that it will become easier to find new antibiotics if we gain a better understanding of the communities of bacteria living in each of us—as many as 1,000 different types of microbes live in our intestines, for example. Disruption to those microbial communities—our “microbiome”—can herald AMR. McDonald says that Big Data and machine learning will be needed to unlock our microbiomes, and that’s where much of the medical community’s investment is going.\\n\\nHe predicts that within five years, hospitals will take fecal samples or skin swabs and sequence the microorganisms in them as a kind of pulse check on antibiotic resistance. “Just doing the bioinformatics to sort out what’s there and the types of antibiotic resistance that might be in that microbiome is a Big Data challenge,” McDonald says. “The only way to make sense of it, going forward, will be advanced analytic techniques, which will no doubt include machine learning.”\\n\\nReducing Resistance on the Farm\\n\\nBringing information closer to where it’s needed could also help reduce agriculture’s contribution to the antibiotic resistance problem. Antibiotics are widely given to livestock to promote growth or prevent disease. In the United States, more kilograms of antibiotics are administered to animals than to people, according to data from the FDA.\\n\\nOne company has developed a rapid, on-farm diagnostics tool to provide livestock producers with more accurate disease detection to make more informed management and treatment decisions, which it says has demonstrated a 47% to 59% reduction in antibiotic usage. Such systems, combined with pressure or regulations to reduce antibiotic use in meat production, could also help turn the AMR tide.\\n\\nBreaking Down Data Silos Is the First Step\\n\\nAdding to the complexity of the fight against AMR is the structure and culture of the global healthcare system itself. Historically, healthcare has been a siloed industry, notorious for its scattered approach focused on transactions rather than healthy outcomes or the true value of treatment. There’s no definitive data on the impact of AMR worldwide; the best we can do is infer estimates from the information that does exist.\\n\\nThe biggest issue is the availability of good data to share through mobile solutions, to drive HCI clinical-decision support tools, and to feed supercomputers and machine-learning platforms. “We have a fragmented healthcare delivery system and therefore we have fragmented information. Getting these sources of data all into one place and then enabling them all to talk to each other has been problematic,” McDonald says.\\n\\nCollecting, integrating, and sharing AMR-related data on a national and ultimately global scale will be necessary to better understand the issue. HCI and mobile tools can help doctors, hospitals, and public health authorities collect more information while advanced analytics, machine learning, and in-memory computing can enable them to analyze that data in close to real time. As a result, we’ll better understand patterns of resistance from the bedside to the community and up to national and international levels, says Solomon. The good news is that new technology capabilities like AI and new potential streams of data are coming online as an era of data sharing in healthcare is beginning to dawn, adds McDonald.\\n\\nThe ideal goal is a digitally enabled virtuous cycle of information and treatment that could save millions of dollars, lives, and perhaps even civilization if we can get there.

       " 'Pistonheads\\n\\nLogin or register for classifieds\\n\\nHello\\n\\nsign out of classifieds\\n\\nAston Martin\\'s David King: PH Meets\\n\\nMatt Bird posted on Tuesday, March 21, 2017 in Features\\n\\nHead of the Valkyrie project, heavily involved with the AMR cars and a manual fan too - PH chats with David King\\n\\nDavid King may not be a familiar Aston name to many, but he\\'s been a very busy man of late. As Vice President and Chief Special Operations Officer he has headed up the Valkyrie project and been integral to the introduction of the AMR products as well. Hence he was a man in demand at Geneva! In our few minutes with him at the Palexpo we discussed the Valkyrie and the AMR cars of course, but also the future for both manuals and hybrids in the Aston line up, plus what the 911 GT3 RS has to do with Aston Martins... Enjoy!\\n\\nJust seven Vantage AMR Pros will be made\\n\\nWhat has been learnt from the GT8 and GT12 to be taken into the Vantage AMR Pro projects? They are both recently launched track ready projects. \"The Vantage is a little bit of what we learned on those cars but it\\'s also directly coming out of the GTE race car. The idea was to create a tribute for the drivers\\' championship last year, which means it does have some direct content: it\\'s a got a WEC rear wing on it, and it\\'s got a WEC bonnet on it and it\\'s got a 500hp V8 with some WEC tuning in it. It\\'s not strictly a WEC engine though, of course.\"\\n\\nWhat sort of stuff has been changed for the engine then? Are there tweaks to the internals as well as electronics and the like? \"Yes! So it\\'s got a strengthened block from the WEC car, it\\'s got new cams, an entirely new intake system and a new exhaust. It\\'s not emissions capable as a road car, so we\\'re selling it as a track only car. We\\'ve announced we\\'re only going to build a run of seven as track-only cars, but it\\'s capable through a third party of being Single Vehicle Approved (time to call Lanzante then! - MB) certainly in the UK; it would go on the road fairly easily. As a manufacturer we can\\'t do it because it doesn\\'t meet emissions.\\n\\n\"So really the idea was to take the brand we\\'ve created called Aston Martin Racing and all the successes we\\'ve had - particularly when we\\'ve stuck with GT racing - over the last few years, and use the power of that brand more in the mainstream, in the production versions of cars. Because what we\\'ve learnt from the GT8 and GT12 is that a) we know how to make hardcore road cars that are track day capable b) that there are some customers out there who want them and c) that there will continue to be a market for them.\\n\\nKing is involved with the GT racing programme too\\n\\n\"And having got a foot in the door, we can now make that a more permanent part of our range. How better than to the use the AMR acronym as our performance brand for the road cars? The intention is then that we will do that on two levels - the Vantage is an AMR Pro with serious tuning, lightweighting, a hardcore car, and then base AMR - like the Rapide - is a bit of body tweaking, a tweak of performance, adding some nice colour and trim features - a bit more like an AMG Line kind of car. And that base AMR we will roll out across the whole range; the hardcore stuff, the AMR Pros, we\\'ll be quite selective on and might be a future equivalent of a GT8 or a Vulcan, stuff like that.\"\\n\\nAnd is the Rapide AMR limited production also? \"Yeah. So our bosses decided the production volume, and said we were going to make 210 of them which coincides with the vehicle\\'s top speed. That does also mean it\\'s classed as the fastest four-door car in the world I think. The speed comes more from the aero tweaks than the power (now up to 600hp - MB) actually.\"\\n\\nA slightly broader question off the back of the AMR debuts: do you still see manual gearboxes having a future in fast Astons? There\\'s been a bit of a resurgence recently, and Aston has of course been involved with cars like the V12 Vantage S.\\n\\n\"Massively, yeah. Andy (Palmer) ended his speech this morning saying that there will always be three pedals and a stick available in an Aston. It was great for him to say that because, however good the paddleshifts and automatics become - they might be the most efficient, or fastest around a track - you are losing that interaction with the vehicle. So it\\'s a commitment Andy has made and I\\'m happy to oblige.\"\\n\\nManuals are staying in Astons - hurrah!\\n\\nAnd on the automatic side, are you planning on sticking with the eight-speed ZF and the Speedshift automated manual? Or do you see a point where it will be auto only? Perhaps a dual-clutch? (At this point the Aston PR spokesperson who is also present interjects to say that the question took the interview into \"muddy waters\" that couldn\\'t be discussed; nothing further was mentioned of it, but the comment should provide additional context to David King\\'s answer when he gets to it - MB)\\n\\n\"I would say for the eight-speed speed though, the improvement in driveability, speed of shift and the dynamics of the gearbox have been dramatic over the years. I think the threat of the DCTs to the automatic manufacturers has really upped their game, creating competition in the market. If you drive a DB11 you wouldn\\'t want for anything else really.\"\\n\\nOK, excellent. I suppose we should talk about the Valkyrie as well... \"I suppose we should talk about my life\\'s work, yes!\"\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot to get through! It\\'s a very exciting project - how far into it are we now? \"We\\'re pretty well advanced in the virtual world, so it exists pretty much complete in CAD; we\\'re running optimisation simulation on that at the moment, digital assemblies and things like that. We\\'re getting to the point where we\\'ll soon be releasing major parts for tooling and then we\\'ll be building prototypes starting from the end of the year. It will be a big year of testing next year as we gear up for production in 2019. That\\'s working with a Formula 1 team, doing dynamic simulation, doing aero simulation to a level far beyond what we would go with a road car; it\\'s really pretty amazing. Our job is to realise Adrian Newey\\'s vision, to perfection - that\\'s what he\\'s after.\"\\n\\nValkyrie still on track for 2019 launch\\n\\nWhich elements of the car is Aston solely responsible for? And what will Red Bull contribute? \"So we are the vehicle manufacturer; we\\'re responsible for signing it off, for testing it, building it to our standards. We\\'re also engineering many of the typical road car type things like doors that open and close, seals, windscreen wipers, electronics and interior trim. Adrian\\'s got the lead on the overall concept.\"\\n\\nWhat about the engine? Is it entirely bespoke for this car? \"Yes, it\\'s a unique V12 for this car, built by Cosworth. It will be the highest revving engine in a road car and it\\'s a beautiful thing - Cosworth are doing a great job. We will release some more details on that later.\"\\n\\nAre customers at the moment existing customers who have worked their way up? Or conquests from other manufacturers? \"While we would never talk about specific customers, I would say that it\\'s certainly brought in some new clients as well as our existing loyal base.\" (Here again the PR spokesperson extends the point to say that the more focused road cars have also brought a \"different subset\" of buyers to the Aston brand - MB)\\n\\n\"People that... you know, hardcore GT3 RS drivers that would never have looked at an Aston before are now seeing cars like the GT8 and stuff like that and they\\'re coming on board. That\\'s quite pleasing for me! It\\'s not that we\\'re looking to change the whole image of the company, but there\\'s an important subset of our buyers that after that hardcore type of car - we\\'re now able to cater to them, as well as traditional, more understated GTs. The GT8 is about as lairy a road car as you\\'ll find and yet not in a chavvy sort of way. There\\'s still a class about it.\"\\n\\nWe probably should discuss hybrid technology also... \"The Valkyrie\\'s a hybrid!\"\\n\\nCould AMR extras extend to used cars too?\\n\\nYes it is! We have a link to go on then. Where do you see hybrid technology being incorporated into the rest of the Aston range? If at all? \"The only thing related to alternative powertrains that we\\'ve publically declared at the moment is our intention to make a battery electric Rapide. So beyond that we\\'d be dipping into stuff that we haven\\'t talked about yet. But, you know, Andy Palmer\\'s a battery-electric guy through and through, that\\'s his focus for us. That isn\\'t to say that hybrid won\\'t have a role to play for us, but I think everyone recognises that hybrids are fairly transitionary technology now, and they\\'re compromised.\"\\n\\nDo you think with the AMR cars that there is a likely to be one at a time, or a series of models available? Once Audi only had one RS product on sale at a time, and now that\\'s changed. \"I think on the base AMR you will see continual availability across most of the range eventually. For the AMR Pros I think they will be very limited production cars, with the opportunity from those to spin off a range of AMR accessories too. Our accessory range is a little (pauses) comfort and convenience orientated at the moment. There\\'s a whole world out there; the tuner market is doing very nicely at the moment.\"\\n\\nOK, so I suppose you could have a suspension or a power kit if you didn\\'t want a full model? \"Yes, that kind of thing. We have a whole car park of current Vantages out there - a great car, it\\'s quite affordable now. I\\'m speculating now, but I\\'d like to think we could offer a kind of track day upgrade kit for those cars, parts that boost performance at a reasonable price.\"\\n\\nP.H.

Lovely thing.\\n\\nMax_Torque 16 hours ago\\n\\nIt still amazes me, given what Porsche, Ferrari, Mclaren et-al have been doing for years, that it\\'s taken AML this long to officially leverage anything from there racing team. I put together a concept Vantage back in 2006 (when the car was still very fresh and sort after) that took it\\'s styling and component leads from the race cars to make a \"GT-3\" type road car. Eventually of course, AML have done things like the N24 series, but it\\'s all quite low key and not brilliantly tied to the race teams success and excellent brand image.\\n\\ndazwalsh 14 hours ago\\n\\nWow that rapide is stunning.\\n\\nHerringbone 4 hours ago\\n\\nThe Valkyrie is looking spectacular.

       "   'alchemyapi_text': 'Many in the retail industry were surprised when online startup Jet.com, billed as a potential competitor to Amazon.com for e-commerce supremacy, was sold to Wal-Mart last August for $3.3 billion. The pairing of a cutting-edge digital brand like Jet and a legacy brick-and-mortar retailer like Wal-Mart didn’t seem to be the perfect match. Yet seven months later, the acquisition appears to be working as intended, with Jet operating as a separate entity under the Wal-Mart umbrella.\\nIn an interview at Shoptalk this week with Scott Friend, managing director, Bain Capital Ventures, Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com and now president and CEO, Wal-Mart E-Commerce U.S., discussed why he sold Jet as well as how Wal-Mart is looking to grow its e-commerce business.\\nWhen asked by Friend why he sold Jet to Wal-Mart, Lore responded as follows: “As a startup, you’re selling pieces of the business along the way to venture capitalists. Did you sell the vision that you sold to your customers and employees? Wal-Mart accelerated the vision to reach our goals for customers and employees. Wal-Mart offered us the capital to do that. It ended up being a no-brainer.”\\nLore was impressed with Wal-Mart’s core values, which he admitted didn’t always have the best reputation, and was able to build trust with Wal-Mart’s CEO Doug McMillon and the company’s board of directors. They have empowered Lore and his Jet team, headquartered in Hoboken, N.J., to run Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business. Lore noted that McMillon has done the same with the three e-commerce businesses that Wal-Mart has acquired since Jet became part of the company, including Shoebuy.com, Moosejaw and ModCloth.\\n“We’re asking those leaders to run those product categories for the entire organization,” said Lore, citing Shoebuy as an example, as its leadership team will handle for online sales of footwear for the entire Wal-Mart organization. “Giving these acquired companies the authority to control those businesses means everything to entrepreneurs to have that empowerment.”\\nLore announced that Wal-Mart is launching an incubator called Store No. 8 to develop digital startups. Wal-Mart would own the startups, which would provide the world’s largest company the opportunity to look further out into the future.\\n“It’s harder to think about innovating five [years], 10 years out when investing in meeting short-term goals,” said Lore.\\nStore No. 8 is an example of the innovation that’s taking place at Wal-Mart, which Lore credits McMillon and the executive team for.\\n“It’s incredibly challenging for a legacy retailer to hand over the keys to a startup” noted Lore. “You need executive buy-in. Doug McMillon was a benefactor from the beginning. It [acquiring Jet] was a risky, bold move at the time, but it’s working out well so far. I’m hoping to continue to prove Doug and the board correct.”\\nTo close the interview, Lore was asked about the future of e-commerce, both for Wal-Mart and the industry as a whole. His answer: he’s more convinced every day of the advantages of being an omnichannel retailer.\\nTo capitalize on its omnichannel advantages, Lore has restructured Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business. Jet.com and Walmart.com now share back-end logistics and merchandising, and he’s created an “all-star team” compromised of the top talent between the two companies. And Lore is excited about Wal-Mart’s future.\\n“Doug and the exec team have delivered on their promises,” Lore said. “I’ve been so impressed with the values of the company. It operates with the highest integrity. I’ve been completely converted on the value system having been in the door.”\\n',\n",

       "   'alchemyapi_text': 'Many in the retail industry were surprised when online startup Jet.com, billed as a potential competitor to Amazon.com for e-commerce supremacy, was sold to Wal-Mart last August for $3.3 billion. The pairing of a cutting-edge digital brand like Jet and a legacy brick-and-mortar retailer like Wal-Mart didn’t seem to be the perfect match. Yet seven months later, the acquisition appears to be working as intended, with Jet operating as a separate entity under the Wal-Mart umbrella.\\nIn an interview at Shoptalk this week with Scott Friend, managing director, Bain Capital Ventures, Marc Lore, the founder of Jet.com and now president and CEO, Wal-Mart E-Commerce U.S., discussed why he sold Jet as well as how Wal-Mart is looking to grow its e-commerce business.\\nWhen asked by Friend why he sold Jet to Wal-Mart, Lore responded as follows: “As a startup, you’re selling pieces of the business along the way to venture capitalists. Did you sell the vision that you sold to your customers and employees? Wal-Mart accelerated the vision to reach our goals for customers and employees. Wal-Mart offered us the capital to do that. It ended up being a no-brainer.”\\nLore was impressed with Wal-Mart’s core values, which he admitted didn’t always have the best reputation, and was able to build trust with Wal-Mart’s CEO Doug McMillon and the company’s board of directors. They have empowered Lore and his Jet team, headquartered in Hoboken, N.J., to run Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business. Lore noted that McMillon has done the same with the three e-commerce businesses that Wal-Mart has acquired since Jet became part of the company, including Shoebuy.com, Moosejaw and ModCloth.\\n“We’re asking those leaders to run those product categories for the entire organization,” said Lore, citing Shoebuy as an example, as its leadership team will handle for online sales of footwear for the entire Wal-Mart organization. “Giving these acquired companies the authority to control those businesses means everything to entrepreneurs to have that empowerment.”\\nLore announced that Wal-Mart is launching an incubator called Store No. 8 to develop digital startups. Wal-Mart would own the startups, which would provide the world’s largest company the opportunity to look further out into the future.\\n“It’s harder to think about innovating five [years], 10 years out when investing in meeting short-term goals,” said Lore.\\nStore No. 8 is an example of the innovation that’s taking place at Wal-Mart, which Lore credits McMillon and the executive team for.\\n“It’s incredibly challenging for a legacy retailer to hand over the keys to a startup” noted Lore. “You need executive buy-in. Doug McMillon was a benefactor from the beginning. It [acquiring Jet] was a risky, bold move at the time, but it’s working out well so far. I’m hoping to continue to prove Doug and the board correct.”\\nTo close the interview, Lore was asked about the future of e-commerce, both for Wal-Mart and the industry as a whole. His answer: he’s more convinced every day of the advantages of being an omnichannel retailer.\\nTo capitalize on its omnichannel advantages, Lore has restructured Wal-Mart’s e-commerce business. Jet.com and Walmart.com now share back-end logistics and merchandising, and he’s created an “all-star team” compromised of the top talent between the two companies. And Lore is excited about Wal-Mart’s future.\\n“Doug and the exec team have delivered on their promises,” Lore said. “I’ve been so impressed with the values of the company. It operates with the highest integrity. I’ve been completely converted on the value system having been in the door.”\\n',\n",

GeekSeller\\'s app provides Jet.com sellers with an administrator panel to manage inventory and process orders faster and more efficiently..\\n\"ShipStation has received many requests to integrate with Jet.com,\" says ShipStation\\'s VP of Marketing, Robert Gilbreath. \"GeekSeller is a great way to offer Jet.com sellers access to ShipStation\\'s robust features and automations.\"\\nLaunched in July 2015, Jet.com is a free online shopping site dedicated to saving customers money in many ways. It was acquired by Wal-Mart in August 2016. The fast-growing company sees more than 400,000 new shoppers added every month and processes an average of 25,000 orders every day.\\nGeekSeller is an officially approved Jet.com partner that offers an affordable API integration solution. It provides customers the ability to manage inventory, edit products, and import items in bulk via CSV/XLS file, or directly from a shopping platform, as well as managing orders, returns and refunds. In addition, since Jet.com requires merchants to accept orders within 15 minutes of the order being placed, GeekSeller can automate the approval process of the orders. GeekSeller even provides GeekSeller Repricing, a functionality which dynamically adjusts its merchant\\'s prices to make their products priced lowest on the Jet.com marketplace.  \\nThe ShipStation integration offers GeekSeller\\'s merchants the ability to save time and money on the shipping and fulfillment process. ShipStation\\'s features include a free Stamps.com USPS shipping account (savings of $15.99 per month), which includes deeply discounted USPS rates; automation features that provide the least expensive shipping option based on type of product, weight and geography; order consolidation from multiple sales channels including Amazon, eBay and many more; batch printing of more than 500 shipping labels at once, even wirelessly, from a large variety of thermal or desktop (inkjet or laser) printers, from a Mac, PC, or mobile device and more.\\n\"This partnership with ShipStation gives our users access to the best solution on the market to manage their orders\\' fulfillment flow,\" offers Daniel Sodkiewicz,\\xa0GeekSeller Co-Founder.\\nAbout ShipStation \\nShipStation is the leading web-based shipping solution that helps e-commerce retailers import, organize, process, and ship their orders quickly and easily from any web browser.

GeekSeller\\'s app provides Jet.com sellers with an administrator panel to manage inventory and process orders faster and more efficiently..\\n\\n\"ShipStation has received many requests to integrate with Jet.com,\" says ShipStation\\'s VP of Marketing, Robert Gilbreath. \"GeekSeller is a great way to offer Jet.com sellers access to ShipStation\\'s robust features and automations.\"\\n\\nLaunched in July 2015, Jet.com is a free online shopping site dedicated to saving customers money in many ways.

ShipStation\\'s features include a free Stamps.com USPS shipping account (savings of $15.99 per month), which includes deeply discounted USPS rates; automation features that provide the least expensive shipping option based on type of product, weight and geography; order consolidation from multiple sales channels including Amazon, eBay and many more; batch printing of more than 500 shipping labels at once, even wirelessly, from a large variety of thermal or desktop (inkjet or laser) printers, from a Mac, PC, or mobile device and more.\\n\\n\"This partnership with ShipStation gives our users access to the best solution on the market to manage their orders\\' fulfillment flow,\" offers Daniel Sodkiewicz, GeekSeller Co-Founder.\\n\\nAbout ShipStation ShipStation is the leading web-based shipping solution that helps e-commerce retailers import, organize, process, and ship their orders quickly and easily from any web browser.

       "   'text': 'Wal-Mart Subsidiary Jet.com Acquires Women’s Retailer ModCloth\\n\\nTweet\\n\\nEven before Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) paid $3 billion for online retailer Jet.com last year, the acquired company had itself been in full acquisition mode. Since Wal-Mart’s acquisition, Jet.com has added two more retailers, ShoeBuy and outdoor apparel seller Moosejaw.\\n\\nNews website Jezebel reported Wednesday afternoon that Jet.com, through Wal-Mart, has acquired women’s fashion retailer ModCloth for an unspecified sum. The deal is expected to close Thursday and an announcement is scheduled to be announced Friday.\\n\\nAccording to a report at Recode, the struggling retailer had been unable to raise additional capital and likely sold for around $80 million, roughly equal to the amount of venture capital ModCloth had raised since its founding in 2002.\\n\\nWhen Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com last August, the world’s largest retailer said that it would retain the Jet brand in order to “continue to provide a unique and differentiated customer experience with a curated assortment.” ModCloth fits right into that mold.\\n\\nModCloth positions itself as a hip, quirky, independent retailer of “indie-inflected” clothes. The company might fit in with Jet.com or it might not. According to Jezebel, ModCloth CEO Matthew Kaness told employees:\\n\\nI think there’s a lot of overlap culturally with what [Wal-Mart’s] about and what we’re about. I think over time this is going to become an incredible marriage.\\n\\nJezebel then noted, “In the recording we heard, employees in the room can be heard laughing in what sounds like disbelief.”\\n\\nDoesn’t sound exactly like a marriage made in heaven, does it? But at least the VCs didn’t lose any money.\\n\\nWal-Mart shares were down fractionally in Thursday’s premarket session, after closing at $70.58, down about 0.2%, on Wednesday. The stock’s 52-week range is $62.72 to $75.19. The 12-month consensus price target is $74.37.\\n\\nBy Paul Ausick\\n\\nSponsors\\n\\nGet Quote for:\\n\\n',\n",
